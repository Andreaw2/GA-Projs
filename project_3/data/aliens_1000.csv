This story was on the top search result, have not yet verified...

""While ancient alien proponents on TV readily ascribe mystical passages in religious texts as referring to ETs, the famous Oglala Sioux holy man, Black Elk, who lived from 1863 to 1950, toured with Buffalo Bill’s Wild West Show as a young man, and later converted to Catholicism, makes distinctions between that which is spiritual, or mystical, and that which is alien and extra-terrestrial. Much of his writings come off as arcane and symbolic as the Book of Revelations, but in the following passage from Black Elk, The Sacred Ways of a Lakota by Wallace Black Elk and William Lyon, the Sioux shaman does not mince words, having said, “So when I went to vision quest, that disk came from above. The scientists call that a…Unidentified Flying Object, but that’s a joke, see? Because they are not trained, they lost contact with the wisdom, power and gift.…So that disk landed on top of me. It was concave, and there was another one on top of that. It was silent, but it lit and luminesced like neon lights. Even the sacred robes there were luminesced, and those tobacco ties lying there lit up like little light bulbs. Then these little people came, but each little group spoke a different language. They could read minds, and I could read their minds. I could read them. So there was silent communication. You could read it, like when you read silent symbols in a book. So we were able to communicate…They are human, so I welcomed them. I said, “Welcome, Welcome…”",t5am1g,12,,1646256351.0,4,0.8

9,aliens,Reminder,"Hey r/aliens.

I've been offline most of the day.

Regarding some recent events - I want to remind everyone of something.

This topic generates a lot of varying emotions in people - experiencers, skeptics, and everyone in between.

**Regardless of what your opinion(s) is/are one way or the other - you do not have carte blanche to be insulting to one another in this sub or in our discord.**

What I mean by this - is outright name-calling. 

Some of the most common seem to be ""retard,"" ""moron,"" ""idiot,"" etc. Generally, I remove these comments as part of my ""daily sub cleanup"" tasks when I get a chance to hop online, but I missed my morning check-in. I don't see **too** many repeat-offenders, but if you've had a comment pulled where you've insulted someone outright - that was generally me. Repeat offenders I engage with directly.

Please keep all conversations civil. This also falls directly under Rule number 2.

If you don't agree with something someone has posted - it's okay to disagree, but do not get into an insult-throwing competition with OP or anyone else. If you're trying to sway someone to your viewpoint... this is not the way.

Further - we only remove posts that conflict with the rules in the sidebar and an unwritten rule (which we're working on) which deals with 'potential religious arguments.' 

We certainly don't want anyone here to feel  like they can't come forward with an experience or event that has occurred - and at the same time -  we're not going to stop people from challenging the post, either.

But what will **not be tolerated** is name-calling.

Also - while I'm on this topic.

Christina Gomez posts YouTube video links in here every once in a while.

Sexism or sexist remarks toward her or any other women who post here = instant permanent ban, no discussions or appeals.

Please remember we're all here for a semi-common purpose and try to keep discussions as civil as possible.

Thanks.",t58a5e,22,moderator,1646249986.0,9,0.8
10,aliens,Aliens are previous earth civilizations.,"
TLDR 
Is it possible that aliens are previous iterations of civilization on Earth. 

I’ve been thinking about Lue’s mankinds statement. Also about Tom Delonges interview about them as Gods. I know he went down the loosh rabbit hole, but I think that is a mistake. There are thousands of ancient tribe stories of tribe people interacting with people from the stars who taught them about some form of advanced knowledge could be the stars or something else. What if the previous Earth civilizations come back to see what the newest iteration of life might be. Reptilians, mantids, grays, nordics and the myriad of others could in theory be previous earth civilizations who left due to the cataclysmic cycle. Perhaps that also explains the repeated theme in abductions where the aliens tell us we are using tech incorrectly. They are increasing their presence because our cataclysm is approaching; but, because of our tendency towards war, we aren’t where we should be developmentally in a psychological and technological sense. This is entirely speculative of course, but I’m just trying to piece together the breadcrumbs from a number of prominent sources in the disclosure effort. I’ve gone deeper in the this line of thinking, but want to see what others think about the hypothesis.

The primary criticism is where is the fossil evidence? Well if it was a legitimate hypothesis for NASA to go through the same thought experiment (Silurian Hypothesis), are we working with incomplete information in the archeological record? I don’t know and if someone does they aren’t saying anything. I know that our evolutionary history has become much more complex in recent times. The advent of civilization has been pushed back thousands of years, even our arrival to North America is being rewritten.  As well as, the size and complexity of the civilizations in South America. I would counter that criticism with we don’t know the level of cataclysm that occurred, the technology used, nor do we have a complete history of earth through fossilized remains. Of all the organisms that have theoretically existed very few of them have fossilized[Article](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/what-are-the-odds-of-a-de/). 

We don’t know what we don’t know. It isn’t ludicrous to think we may not be the first form of intelligent life on earth.",t54yl9,118,,1646241239.0,72,0.85

Not too long ago I came across this interview conducted by George Knapp:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F\_iSLAbkPtE&ab\_channel=MysteryWire](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_iSLAbkPtE&ab_channel=MysteryWire)

It's a fantastic and (most importantly) free accounting of the techniques one needs to use to summon a UFO. According to the people in the video they have done it reliably over the course of years. I've tried these techniques and failed.

My problem is that I remain nuts-and-bolts in my heart. I simply do not believe deep down that it is possible to do something like this, even if I'm convinced intellectually there might be something to it.

Yet I would absolutely love to see a UFO. So I'm wondering if there's anyone on this sub who remains analytical but who also thinks they can pull the process off. I'm especially interested in someone who has already done it in the past.

It’s the same as expecting God to come down and suddenly remake the world. If they didn’t intervene in WW2 when 8 million Jews were senselessly slaughtered nor when the US dropped two nukes in Japan. So why now?
  If you point at abduction, we still don’t definitively know if they are actually happening nor do we know why they are happening. Most stories I’ve heard, they either impart advice or just perform some form of procedure. It makes even less sense that they would impart advice then wipe our memory. 
  In my opinion, the logical conclusions are they are observing our development as a society and as an animal. That doesn’t explain the boldness of interactions recently unless they want to desensitize the population. I’m not sure about the control system hypothesis. What or who are they controlling? It certainly isn’t us or we would see greater interactions. I dismiss the whole premise of them harvesting negative emotions. There are too many logical fallacies in that argument.

\-Abductions  
One may say ""duh"", which ufo docu doesn't talk about that! Many do, correct, however this docu had 1 specific detail that made it different from many others;   
\-Prevention of abductions;  
i.e. how some people (in the process of being abducted), were ""released"" from their abduction, something most, if not all, ufologists claim is improbable if not impossible.    
Some things that i remember pretty well;   
\-People interviewed who claimed that calling upon the name of Jesus would ""release"" them from any occurring abduction.  
There was a narration;  
\-A man (interviewer) who realized, whilst driving down a long road, that he had some interview recorded that had the interviewee explain that he ""escaped"" an abduction by calling out to the name of Jesus, however the interviewer never realized what he said, until \[years?\] later, which made him dig up the recording in question and show it to his colleague.   
\-2 men who worked on that project, project being ""preventing abductions"". 

Anyone familiar with this documentary?   
It was uploaded on youtube either in 2012 or 2014, that i can remember.

46,aliens,Collective Brainstorming: How to initiate contact with “The Others”,"There’s a large enough community on here to brainstorm several concrete methods to bait “The Others” into initiating contact. Anyone have any ideas?

These ideas should be based on prior observed behavior of UAPs or their inhabitants. Methods to predict their appearance should be discussed.

My main hypothesis is they’re only seriously concerned with interacting with Earth’s species on a limited basis. 

This can be seen with their abductions (looks like they’re studying us or initiating a genome tweaking program) and animal abductions (possibly as a source of food or tissue samples used within their presumed labs). 

They appear to have total avoidance of people aside from monitoring our national defensive capabilities, but don’t step in when those are used against other humans since they aren’t concerned with that. 

A contingent of hybrids are likely here amongst humans, but at the upper echelons of government to act as a backup control structure (to ensure humans don’t mess with their actions here on Earth). 

-This would be the only place where it would make sense for them to be present since those positions direct society as a whole. 

-That would also explain the supposed ongoing abductions/hybridizations, since *there would be a continued need for replenishment of hybrids at the highest levels of government to keep up with humanity’s growing numbers.*

Enter, the Fermi Paradox. In today's episode, we discussed some more proposed solutions; The Zoo Hypothesis, The Dark Forest Theory, The Great Filter to name a few covered. (Part 2 to episode 66).

Bio: Hello all. What can I say about me? Well, I'm a space/astronomy journalist and a science communicator. And I also enjoy reading and writing hard science fiction. It's not just because of my day job, it's also something I've been enthused about since I was young. By the time I was seventeen, I began writing my own fiction and eventually decided it was something I wanted to pursue.

Aside from writing about things that are ground in real science, I prefer the kind of SF that tackles the most fundamental questions of existence. Like ""Who are we? Where are we going? Are we alone in the Universe?"" In any case, that's what I have always striven for: to write stories that address these questions, and the kind of books that people are similarly interested in them would want to read.

Over the years, I have written many short stories and three full-length novels, all which take place within the same fictional universe. In addition, I have written over a thousand articles for a number of publications on the subjects of science, technology, astronomy, history, cosmology, and the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI).

They have been featured in publications like Business Insider, Phys.org, Real Clear Science, Science Alert!, Futurism, and Knowridge Science Report.",t3ghgg,8,,1646057440.0,2,0.9
51,aliens,Human centric ego,"Tbh this is more of a rant but it's something we need to accept, humans are not the apex life in the universe and I'm sick of these charlatans on podcasts or C2C claiming we are.

Everytime someone says how humans are ""the most spiritually powerful beings in the universe"" or claim we are the best at X in the universe... I genuinely cringe.

Fact is we have limited sensory range and are psychically weak compared to other reported species.

We need to recognise and be critical of these limitations in order to develop effective countermeasures against antagonistic non-human species; not blithely kumbaya-ing about how we're the tits.

52,aliens,Just came along with these CE5 posts and decided to give it a try. I'm still in shock,"So as per usual Sunday night/ Monday morning I'm browsing reddit for weird stuff to turn my brain off.
I'm looking around this sub and read about this technique? For contacting aliens so being the wise man I am I decided well what's the big deal let's do this.

So I do all the stuff being said on both posts clean your mind focus on saying *I'm seeking for knowledge * and try to focus a laser beam coming from my head which still sounds like total bs.

I'm laying in bed for a few minutes and nothing happens so I decided we'll maybe I can reach to someone on this earth like this  so I begin to repeat the name of a friend who I haven't seen in a long time. That's when my heard stars aching and I genuinely feel the inside of my throat getting open as when I'm trying or preparing for singing.

Right after I see myself on my usual routine from Sunday night throwing around clothes that I may use tomorrow for work and some of my mother's clothes too. We live just the two of us so we have to help each other. Then I clean my bed and go to sleep and decide again to do this same routine except this wasn't my home it was the same structure but the rooms are different bed positions different and I even have a wardrobe which I don't have at least on MY house. So again I sleep only this time I actually feel moving out of my body I go to my mother's room and we actually have a walk outside. My mother doesn't seem to notice that it's not me but my Astral body and I feel her grabbing my arm because it's late and we live in a dangerous city. We walk around for a while then visit one of her friends who seem to notice I'm not on my physical form, my mother gets a bit angry and I decided? To go back? The thing is I feel my body is calling me back and I wake up. I open my eyes and see that I'm on the same room I feel a bit confused and tired and rumble around the idea of trying again and this time wake up my mother (who somehow is still on her bed) and tell her the news (on my Astral body yay).

I sleep again only this time I felt a beam of light immediately and then I found myself walking to the store with my  ""mother"" we're getting stuff for dinner and then I tell her about this dream and practice that I found online and tell her about her friend that she saw me and I came back and as I was talking to her something about it her face kind of changed  now she looks more like younger version of officer Wunch from Brooklyn99(a young blonde lady) and I thought to myself that something was wrong. She immediately said to me honey maybe we should find the truth and I ask ""what truth?""  She replied you know what truth or do you want to stay here? I said ""do I want to? It's up to you she said Then she held me by my hands I looked her in the eyes and said ""You're not my mom"" She smiled back at me then said are you sure? I replied ""Yes you're not her"" She tells me how come? I said ""she's has brown hair"" She looks at me and changes her hair color and says like this? I say yes but she's shorter and as I say that she begins to change in size. She asks again like this? Then I tell here ""No I remember her face you're not her and I need to close my eyes"" She smiles at me then I see my mother's face in my head and I open my eyes.

I'm finally here in MY room but can't think straight my thoughts are all over the place everywhere I look I see dots and curves moving around I feel rested and tired at the same time. And just an hour has gone by in what felt like a couple of days.

Now this has happened before to me I've had many different dreams where I'm living different lives many of them pretty vivid. But this is the first time that I actually think I provoked. And the first time that I actually remember most if not all of that journey.

To the people who have been writing about this kind of stuff please I need answers is this normal? Was that lady actually trying to help me get out? And to the people who are exceptic can you help me rationalize what was all of that? I'm still very confused and actually now tired so I'll probably get some sleep hoping I won't travel again need to be on time for work lol.",t3bjx5,5,,1646039811.0,4,0.67

56,aliens,My experience with a remote viewing mediation,"More people need to try CE5 or remote viewing mediation. I was very skeptical okay, I never even meditated before but I figured to try it when someone invited me. let me explain what happened during my first online guided remote viewing session.

About 40 people in a video call on FB. The host guides the meditation to get everyone relaxed. The host has an image on their screen that no one else can see. The host focuses on the image and continues the meditation with breathing to first relax and saying words like ""sounds"" ""colors"" ""feelings"" ""textures"" and others to help trigger your mind into putting descriptions to your surroundings.

The goal is to either draw what you think you see as you go or right when we finish. Then everyone essentially shows what they drew. 

I drew stuff like sand/dirt at the bottom that was brown and white, and swirls of blue at the top. I could tell it was some form of landscape. There wasn't much sunlight. I kept thinking of crashing sounds. But there was an eerie calmness about the crashing. I kept thinking we were in the north, somewhere cold and wet. And I drew lots of large rocks off to the side. And I knew I wasn't alone there, there were two other people there. I drew as I meditated and corrected what I felt was wrong or may have missed. 

The host reveals the image. It is a photo of a couple at the waterline of a beach on a cloudy day somewhere in Vermont or Maine, I forget exactly. The sand was partly covered by the white foam of the seawater, you can see the waves crashing off the rocks off to the side. My drawing, just like many others (although others were also way off) almost perfectly described the photo. 

And I wasn't expecting any of this. Especially online and especially for my first time even meditating like that. I've been rather nervous to continue on with it because the implications this brings if real can be, quite simply, terrifying. I'm sure many of you know of CIA documentation of remote viewing. And just imagine if you contacted some bad entity that then latched onto you. To then proceed to attempt an actual meeting with an ET, I don't know if I could handle it or if they would even greet me due to these fears. I will do it again and push myself farther when I am ready, because I know there is something to this.",t34p8k,28,,1646015816.0,24,0.76
57,aliens,"Ufo me and friend saw, 2006-07 Oklahoma","I never posted to reddit before.
But wanted to share a story me and my close friend saw one summer sitting outside on a school night.

We were 15. Just me and him sitting outside around 10pm. Under this giant pecan tree.
It was a ritual we did every night.
Sit out and dip snuff.

This night as we sat there a green glowing disk came into view directly from the sky in front of us. 

I estimated it being about the size of a small round dinner table. Maybe 5 to 6ft in diameter with maybe 2 ft height. Typical ufo shape.
But small. 

It came into view quickly. From looking at the stars and seeing it sitting there in less than 2 seconds.
And it was close. About 30ft away I would say. Referencing it's height from the tree because it was very close to it.

We stared at it silently. It was quite bright. After sitting stationary for about 1 to 1.5 seconds... it moved closer in a jolt. Now maybe 20 to 25 ft to us (it was somewhat under a tree branch now) 
And sat there for another 1 or 2 seconds.

Then it zipped off at lightning speed back into the sky.

I was frozen in shock. I wasn't going to say anything and my friend said ""did you just fucking see that""....I replied I had.
We really didn't have much else to say other than...well.. let's call it a night...went back inside our houses (we were neighbors)

I think back about this occurance often. We have no idea what it was. One day I'd like to draw it but it's easy to imagine.

Like a green Frisbee glowing with a slight hump in the middle. 
I would imagine, if it were a craft, it was a reconnaissance type vehicle. 

I posted this because I really would like to have this story on reddit just so it isn't lost in my memory later.

And see if perhaps anyone else had a sighting with a similar type of vehicle or object.
I've searched for similar stories and find none that are like what we saw. None green 
Nor small.

I do not believe it to be ball lightning. It moved seemly intelligently. 
It was in, and out. It didn't stick around.
The sky was clear and stars out.
It was I believe summer of 2006 or 2007. South central Oklahoma.

If anyone can relate to story similar to this please share yours.

61,aliens,"Alien abductions, sleep paralysis and getting an out of body experience (Peter Khoury's case.)","I'm on a road trying to discover how alien abductions might work. There are few things not adding up, it's having more physical proof,  them having OOBE's, witnesses are reported seeing lights in the sky, is also the only thing that abductees remember seeing or missing time before undergoing hypnosis.

A few alien abduction cases that standout are [schoolchildren in Zimbabwe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gXpseQ0xyO0&ab_channel=SergeMillimagino) and [Peter Khoury's case](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jyq4QK4N4L4&ab_channel=DISCL0SUR3), are one of the most important alien abduction cases to study as these are physically remembered.

**The case:**  
An Australian man called Peter Khoury in 1992 came home from work after 6 in the morning, he laid in his bed and felt something like a cat was jumping on it, he bended forward and suddenly saw 2 naked females on his bed, one Asian type and one blonde female.  
He noticed they both had larger eyes and weren't talking, the blonde female on top of him touched his leg after he became paralyzed and couldn't move anymore at that moment. She pushed his face against her breast's and he tried to resist but was too strong for him so he took a bite and believed it to have been a nipple or something and swallowed it after, she didn't react in pain at all.

[Sketch of his encounter.](https://preview.redd.it/63z5fqgd1gk81.jpg?width=1668&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=35ad650bc1a9ef0517478c90b861271acdefd8cc)

He remembered it as *an half out of body experience on his bed* ***(remember this for later)***, both females looked at each other and his intuition could understand what they where thinking or saying, called telepathy.   
They where both looking at each other saying: *''We have done this wrong, this isn't the way it supposed to be, we have done this wrong.''*  
Since he swallowed something, it gave a bad chemical taste after, he had to cough all the time after they vanished into thin air.   
He went to the bathroom and noticed there were 2 blonde hairs left behind after his experience, one blonde hair was even embedded inside his skin near his shaft and was painful to remove. There is where he thought, this experience was not right and saved both pieces of hair for DNA testing.   
The Root was of rare ancient Mongoloid and the other of ancient Celtic DNA, aboriginal and part unknown to the human mainstream. 

**My analysis:**  
Peter Khoury's description and from the Schoolchildren in Zimbabwe fit most abductees stories from the past and future cases, some scientist put this as Sleep paralysis, mass hysteria or false memories, that's not possible with these 2 cases as there is supporting evidence and not retrieved from hypnosis.

What I picked up from most abduction experiences are lights, missing time, out of body experiences, lack of proof, it being dreamlike and happening in the same way.  
Whether real or not, we have to look at the possibilities of it being real in a way. Abduction encounters support what the government mentions which are unexplained sightings with a unusual pattern in the sky called UFO's which are mostly lights. 

**My Theory:**  
At first I thought could it maybe be an out of body experience where the soul leaves the body? That wouldn't be possible as abductees have the same clothes on, having physical marks left behind like Scoop marks, or even small implants put inside their body or missing time during the day.   
My guess on OOBE's during abductions would be a timeframe skip of the the past, at the same time being in a future presence which you perceive as sleep paralysis being stuck and a sort of out of body experience. 

This could explain why aliens are maybe able to pass through walls like a ghost, or even leave a hair embedded inside your skin. This brings us to the next theory of Albert Einstein's friend [David Bohm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Bohm) and the Quantum dream theory, that we live in a holographic universe, it's very comparable to a VR headset or projector reflecting on a surface which we perceive as 3D through our perception and senses. This theory could explain so much we are dealing with like Deja Vu or perhaps  even the Mandela effect and there being parallel universes and all being a simulation with limitations called the law of physics and the illusion of time.

Could these light orbs be aliens dematerializing into photons, an output from a different input dimension? Are we living in the input of reality and they come to us as an output from their existence either done through technology or with the mind which Buddhist's called the [rainbow body](https://www.google.com/search?q=rainbow+body&oq=rainbow+body&aqs=chrome.0.69i59j0i512l4j0i10i512j46i512j69i60.293j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8)?  
Once that light projects to you neurologically you'll perceive it as an hallucination through perception like in the case with the schoolchildren in Zimbabwe, some of the children saw lights as for other witnesses further away, only few children in the group saw the grays being projected to them.  
Aliens could be inter dimensional or from another timeframe where the law of our physics do not apply to them.

This is what I learned from going through a lot of abduction cases and other theories all together and somewhat a bit of my own.

63,aliens,What if UFO's neither broke nor bent the Laws of Physics?,"General Relativity: An Alternative Solution & An Exercise In Critical Thinking

{Although this subject does touch upon UAP’s and aliens, it’s actually about the physics involved.}

Foreword: There was a time when new theories and discoveries in Physics made me think that physicists were beginning to understand the Universe. But Politics {like UAP’s exist but UFO’s don’t} ruined the most promising theories and lines of investigation. So when it was announced that the Universe seemed to be expanding faster than the Speed of Light, I was disappointed. When it was announced that 96% of the Universe was comprised of Dark Matter (Dark Energy soon followed) I gave up hope that physicists would ever get back on track within my lifetime.

Because I haven’t been paying attention to what physicists have been saying for the past few decades, what follows may have already been suggested and accepted. {I only found out about the UAP announcement a few days ago by accident.}

Please note, what follows could be very wrong and based upon my ignorance. That is one of the flaws of Critical Thinking... if your premise is incorrect, and especially if you ignore or are unaware of a critical fact, almost everything which follows must also be incorrect.

&#x200B;

Part One: Relative Time

A version of “Relativity” most people have no difficulty in understanding is the Doppler Effect. People understand that when a Sound, or an Electro-magnetic wave, is (Relatively) moving toward an Observer its Frequency appears to become compressed (shortened; and therefore more Frequent). Likewise, when that Frequency is (Relatively) moving away from an Observer, it appears to have been expanded (lengthened; and therefore less Frequent). So Relative to themselves, those Frequencies remain unchanged, but Relative to an Observer they can appear to be very different.

To continue. We know that a barely perceptible short wave length (Frequency) of Sound or Light can seem to disappear, if it becomes compressed even further by its motion Relative to us; likewise a barely perceptible long wave length (Frequency) can also seem to disappear if its Relative motion away from us lengthens that Frequency {the opposite is equally true}. Those Frequencies are still there; and Relative to themselves, they never changed. They also didn’t somehow become mysterious Dark Frequencies; it’s just they can’t be perceived in our Relative Universe without the proper technologies.

I want you to think for a moment about Einstein’s theory about Relative Time. He told us that if an Astronaut could travel at nearly the Speed of Light, after a four (4) year journey and returning to Earth, the Astronaut would discover a century (100 years) had passed on Earth.

Since we know that the Speed of Light is a Constant, we know that the furthest any Light from the Astronauts spacecraft could have travelled is 4 Light Years (the Time the Astronaut and Spacecraft were travelling... Relative to the Astronaut).

But since we also know that the Speed of Light is a Constant, the furthest any Light from the planet (Earth) could have travelled was 100 Light years (the Time the Astronaut and Spacecraft were travelling... Relative to the Earthlings.)

So the Relativity of Time can make it appear as if the Earthling’s Universe expanded at 25X the Speed of Light (Relative to the Astronaut) and also appear as if the Astronaut’s Universe is missing 96% of every Matter/Energy interaction that took place in the past century (Relative to the Earthling’s).

Since both the Astronaut and the Earthlings are part of the same Normal Universe, with the same normal matter and energy, isn’t it amazing how the Doppler Effect upon Time’s Frequencies can change its appearance?

Now I know you’ve been told that 96% of the Universe appears to be missing, and that it is composed of mysterious Dark Matter and Dark Energy. I also know you’ve been told that somehow the Universe is expanding faster than the Speed of Light; and several people have proposed theories as to why. But since we are Relative Observers of that Relative Universe, isn’t it far more likely that the Doppler Effect upon Time’s Frequencies has just made what should be perceivable, unperceivable without the proper technologies?

&#x200B;

An Aside: My father taught me that a problem cannot be solved until both the problem, and the language used to describe the problem/solution, are defined.

When I was in my mid-teens (1974), I played with some of the philosophical conundrums which had been handed down to us from antiquity. Since these conundrums are other peoples interpretations of a different language, I discovered that by using synonyms to redefine the wording of those problems, the conundrums were not conundrums at all. They were hidden truths!

The one exception where I just couldn’t find the correct synonyms was the question of ‘what happens when an unstoppable force encounters an immovable object?’

When I finally gave up I said to myself, “I don’t know, but it would make one heck of a big bang! ??Big Bang??!”

&#x200B;

(As it is currently defined, Newton’s Law of Gravity disobeys Newton’s Third Law of Motion.)

Part Two: Gravity

Experiments is orbit with water droplets revealed that they try to take on a spherical form. Since we know that water tries to conform to the shape of its environment, that suggests to us that when Water’s environment is it’s own Gravitational attraction, the Force of Gravity probably manifests spherically.

Mathematically, it is simpler to draw a circle/sphere using a radius and a circumference; and in doing so we are presented with a logical centre that mathematically defines it. So when defining Gravity, having everything attracted toward a mathematical centre can, in extreme cases, seem to prove/create a Singularity.

But what if Gravity were a Function of Mass and not of Mathematical Locations? In a sphere of pure/non-isotopic iron, all the atoms (masses) are equal; all have an equal amount of Gravitational Force; and all are trying to pull every other Mass to its location. Then instead of a sphere forming because everything is being attracted to a mathematical centre, a sphere forms because it is the most efficient shape to contain the most Mass in the least Volume.

If that were the case, the sphere of iron would not be a single Mass trying to pull everything towards a mathematical location, but a Conglomerate Mass with a Conglomerate Gravitational Force comprised of Individual Masses with Individual Gravitational Forces all of which are in conflict with each other.

Think for a moment of a star being a Conglomerate Mass. We know that every time we double (2X) the radius of a sphere, there is eight times (8X) as much volume. So while the number of atoms along each half of a radius would be equal, the moment we take any degree of arc, the outer half will have seven times (7X) as much Mass as the inner half (7X+1X=8X).

How do you create a Singularity when there is seven times (7X) as much Mass trying to pull the inside out as there is Mass (1X) trying to pull the outside in? Especially when all those Masses couldn’t care less where they are within a Conglomeration and all they want to do is pull the other Masses to their location? {7X as much Mass trying to pull the inside out could help to explain super-nova’s though.} 

To re-iterate, if Gravity is a Function of Mass, individual Masses (like Quarks) do not have the necessary Gravitational Force to Big Crunch other nearby Masses. Instead, all of those individual Masses/Forces are mindlessly jostling for position and not ‘team-players’ uniting to Crush their opponents.

As further proof, the Force of Gravity diminishes over distance. So an atom which is near another atom is going to have a greater attraction with that atom than one which is on the exact opposite side of a planet. Ergo, there is no crushing Gravitational Force through the centre of a Conglomerate Mass because that’s where *the attraction has the least effect and not the greatest*.

&#x200B;

Gravity Redefined:

When we film an explosion, we can observe its shock wave. One of the things that can be said of that shock wave is that it manifests as an *expanding spherical force*. Gravity does exactly the opposite and manifests as a *contracting spherical force*. This equal-but-opposite definition for two manifestations of Motion allows Gravity to obey Newton’s Third Law of Motion, and it easily fits within what we can Observe. {As opposed to creating a new and undiscovered “anti-gravitational force.”}

&#x200B;

Part Three: Time and Gravity

In a Relative Universe, where Time is not a Constant, the Universe can appear to be both expanding 25X faster than the Speed of Light, and the Speed of Light can appear to be 96% slower than it should be.

Studies with Photons have shown us that they have Frequency, but that when they are stopped by a barrier, they become a Particle of Mass. In other words, Energy can manifest as a Frequency of Energy, or as a Mass, but not both at the same Time! (Proving Einstein’s equation E=mC2 and/or m=E/C2.}

Furthermore, if “stopped” Energy manifests as Mass, then everything that we perceive as Mass is actually Energy travelling at the Speed of Light but not at the same Relative Time we are experiencing.

{A further explanation follows the upcoming ""Aside""}

&#x200B;

An Aside:

Imagine a Grey Alien walking at 3 mph but experiencing 25X more Time than we are. We would see that Alien breaking(?) the Laws of Physics and walking at 75mph. Do you know of any human that could both casually walk and effortlessly make a right angle turn at 75mph? What would you think if you saw a helicopter travelling at a Relative 100 mph to it, and to you it was travelling at a Relative 2500 mph?

If Mass and Energy were the same thing, then synchronizing your Time Frame with that of a solid object would mean that the solid object was now pure energy and you could pass through walls {or fly into stars without worrying}. Many people who claim to have been abducted, state that they somehow passed through solid walls.

Consider the following, if I could make Time pass 25X faster than the Relative Time Earthlings experience, I could travel to a nearby star in 1/25th the Time Earthlings consider possible. If I could also make Time pass 96% slower than the Relative Time Earthlings experience, I could make that trip pass 25^(2)X faster than Earthlings consider possible.

Einstein’s theories tell us that is exactly what can happen. Using the above example, a spaceship travelling at 0.1C (X25) could arrive at a star 10 Light Years away in 4 of Earth’s Relative Years... Likewise 1/25th (4%) of 4 Relative Years is 146.1 days, so the passengers would have made a 10 Light Year trip in less than 5 of their Relative Months.

{Like a cellophane window in an envelope, 25X & 4% are the Frequencies of Time that we should be able to perceive and/or infer through Observation. They are not necessarily the upper and lower limits of what is possible.}

Part Three cont’d:

If you’ve ever heard of a uniform background radiation, consider it not evidence of a Big Bang, but instead of evidence that Energy is Uniformly spread throughout Space. That which we Relatively perceive as Light and Mass is merely that Energy manifesting itself in the Time Frames we can perceive. That which we call “Dark” is merely Energy manifesting in Time Frames we cannot perceive.

Ditto for Gravitational Energy.

Now, if entire Galaxies are moving away from us at 25X the Speed of Light, and only Energy which is “stopped” can form Mass, you might wonder how those Galaxies, which have Mass, can possibly exist. In part, the answer is in the Relativity of the Doppler Effect. Regardless of how fast or slow Energy appears to be moving Relative to us, Relative to itself, that Energy is moving at the Constant Speed of Light. The other part is explained below.

Counter-intuitive Mass:

Earlier I mentioned that when we stop a Photon, it changes from a Frequency of Energy into a Particle (Mass). Imagine doing the same thing with a car.

When a fast moving car is stopped by a barrier, its shape becomes compressed. The same is true for a Frequency of Energy which, when stopped by a barrier, becomes a Particle. Likewise, we know that a compressed frequency means there are more occurrences of that frequency, not fewer. So while particles (Masses) seem to be stopped, in actuality they have a greater Relative Frequency than Relatively free flowing energy. That means they **inversely** prove Einstein was on the right track... The more frequently energy oscillates, Relative to us, the more Mass it seemingly produces. But instead of infinite oscillations creating infinite Mass, finite, but more frequent oscillations create correspondingly denser Mass. (Relatively denser Mass to us, but pure, free flowing energy Relative to itself... Energy can neither be created nor destroyed; but it can be Relatively Modified.)

{Ergo: that which is called a Singularity is not a melding of all Masses into a single Mass, but instead each Individual Mass’s Time Frequency becoming denser/more-compressed, but which, Relative to itself, is just Energy moving at the Constant Speed of Light.}

&#x200B;

Gravity, Time, and Atomic Clocks:

Einstein told us that Time was not a Constant. Experiments with Atomic Clocks in airplanes, and eventually in orbit confirmed to us that Gravity somehow Compresses Time and makes Atomic Clocks ‘tick’ faster. Likewise, the additional Velocity applied to Atomic Clocks made them ‘tick’ slower. That’s  one of the main reasons Atomic Clocks which are not experiencing exactly the same amount of Velocity and Gravity need to be synchronized.

So if Gravity were indeed a Compressive Force, and Velocity in opposition to Gravity was a manifestation of an Expansive Force, then we shouldn’t be surprised to discover these Forces Compress and/or Expand Time’s Frequencies.

{Note: The shock wave of an explosion ‘extends’ in all directions which manifests as a sphere. Perhaps saying ‘Extensive’ instead of ‘Expansive’ would be a better choice.}

In Closing:

Earlier I mentioned the conundrum of what would happen if an unstoppable force encountered an immovable object... a very Big Bang. Experiments with photons have told us everything seems to manifest as either Energy, or Mass, but not at the same Time. Could our experiments be telling us something fundamental about our Universe which we are ignoring?

PS:

Q: What is the difference between a massive source of Gravity (Singularity) not allowing Light to escape its grip, and a massive source of Gravity (dense particles of matter) accelerating Time so that Light seems to disappear?

A: Just the definition of Gravity.",t2xo11,3,,1645995489.0,12,0.64

66,aliens,"This 1955 event in near a school in Bexley, England included a disc that flipped up onto its edge and also changed phases from a gas to a solid as it hovered over several witnesses.","#Bedonwell Primary School 

A dramatic and widely viewed schoolyard encounter began on the afternoon of July 17, 1955. 


Margaret Fry, her son Steve, and Doctor Thukarta were in a car driving through Bexley, England. Thukarta was driving. “After a while,” says Margaret, “we became aware of a heavy shadow over our car. The rest of the sky was bright blue and cloudless, the sun blazing to the left of us. We kept peering through the windscreen, wondering what was causing the shadow engulfing the car.” 

Fry asked the doctor to pull over. Thukarta agreed and as he made a right turn onto another street, the shadow followed them. “By now we definitely knew something was above the car,” Fry said. The car engine suddenly failed and sputtered to a stop. Fry and Thukarta exited the car, while Fry’s son remained inside the car looking out the car window. 


“Once out of the car,” says Fry, “we looked up and were horrified to see *a concentrated mass of gray cloud-like material just barely eighteen feet above our heads. As we watched, this oval mass started spinning. It then slowly solidified, and we saw three ball bearing-like wheels come down from what I thought was a smooth underside…I did think it was landing and would squash us, but we were so shocked we did not think to move away from under it. However, the wheels retracted, and it continued to spin and hum like a top, combined with a slight swooshing sound like the sea…it then flipped up on its side, then righted back again, then flopped down at the crossroads ahead of us*. 


We exclaimed, ‘My God, it’s one of those flying saucer things!’” This occurred at the T-intersection of Ashbourne and Whitfield roads. Both roads were blocked by the massive UFO which had landed right in the middle of the intersection. It hovered about four feet above the ground. 


It was a densely populated area, with houses lining both streets. About a dozen children who had been playing on the street surrounded the craft. Quickly, people rushed out of their homes and cars, and the group of witnesses grew to at least thirty. They surrounded the object, which was making a soft humming noise. “It was a typical bell-shaped craft,” said Fry, “although gray-silver-blue, it was not quite any of those hues; it was more like pewter than shining, in fact it looked just out of this world!” She saw that her son Steve had his face pasted to the car-window and was watching in shock. She was also amazed by the detailed appearance of the object. 


“The craft had indents, or moldings, that I thought must be portholes around the center. Below this was a wide ledge, and above was a rounded dome which had further moldings for a door? What impressed itself in my memory was that the lower circular part was in sections, or so it seemed, with distinct seams and what appeared to be rivets.” 


Rodney Maynard was 15 years old and was one of the witnesses. He was on his lunch break when he heard that something had landed on the road outside. He and his brother (age 16) ran outside and saw the saucer, which he said was “black, sleek and streamlined, with a surface like polished metal…It was very fine and beautiful.” He joined the group, pushing to the front to get a good look. “This thing had landed in the road,” he said. “It took up the whole width of the road and overlapped onto the pavement. It wasn’t on the ground. It had about eight massive suckers. The center was still, but the outer rim was spinning slowly, and it had white lights flashing, like a camera flash…It had what looked like windows, but the glass was concave and molded together so you could not see in. A couple of us went forward to try and touch it, and it began to spin faster.” 


The object then lifted slowly upward just over their heads. Fry says it reached a height of about 100 feet. As she says, “It wobbled from side to side, then stood still when a porthole opened up at about 100 feet. For the first time I felt a real fear, thinking there were people in there. When it was near to the ground and we were standing at arm’s length from it, we were so utterly amazed at the craft itself, that we did not think of aliens or anyone being in it.” 


It then moved slowly down the street until it was hovering over Bedonwell Primary School. It remained over the school for about one minute in full view of witnesses until it suddenly “shot up into the sky and disappeared.” Fry and Thukarta watched it until it reached an estimated altitude of 30,000 feet. It was still in view when they left the area. The Maynard brothers told their parents what had happened. Neither of them was believed. 


Fry says that the experience left her forever changed. “For weeks I really felt I had my feet in two worlds, one with that craft that linked me to another planet. I felt isolated, for my son was too young to discuss it in depth with. Gradually you put it out of your mind and get on with life, but you are never the same again.” Fry eventually joined the BUFORA group and began to investigate and write about UFOs.

Once she had her child she had some weird dreams and then saw her daughter had been drawing pictures of a typical grey being and described one as “the doctor” which triggered the moms memory. Family moves and neither mom nor daughter have experiences anymore. Years later a friend of the moms visits and the two go out for the night, daughter now late teens stays home. On the way home they take a back road for a scenic drive and then bright light in the sky, missing time etc get home go to bed and next morning all 3 have had missing time experiences from the night before and some or all have strange burns on them.

69,aliens,The Bible says that aliens exist,"In his interview on Fade to Black

\[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzLqBx5lN8Y\]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzLqBx5lN8Y]) )

Tom Delonge, who organized the TTSA responsible for leaking the Fighter jet videos of UFOs, said government insiders told him that the UFO phenomenon is intricately linked with religions: ""There are good gods and bad gods, and their interactions have been well-documented throughout history."" An analysis of the Bible confirms what his government contacts told him:

Luke 2:13 says when Jesus was born “ a multitude of the Heavenly Host"" announced Jesus's birth to shepherds . In the original Greek text ""Heavenly Host"" means

“Army from Space / Space Force”.

So a more accurate translation is that when Jesus was born “a multitude of the Army from Space / Space Force” appeared to shepherds to announce his birth.

The correct translation of this phrase comes from Strong's Concordance. This is a well known tool used by Christians for decades to find the original Greek words in the original Greek Bible texts that were translated into English.

In the original Greek text the word translated into English as ""heavenly"" - - means:

""celestial, i.e. Belonging to or coming from the sky""

In other words, the original Greek word translated into English as ""heavenly"" means ""from Space"". Here's a screenshot from Strong's Concordance showing the meaning from the original Greek Bible text of the word ""heavenly"" in Luke 2:13:

[https://i.imgur.com/ahm3LXR.png\](https://i.imgur.com/ahm3LXR.png)](https://i.imgur.com/ahm3LXR.png](https://i.imgur.com/ahm3LXR.png))

A similar search of Strong's Concordance can be done for the word ""host"" in ""heavenly host"", showing that ""host"" in the original Greek text means

""army / military force""

So, in the original Greek language the Bible says when Jesus was born ""a multitude of the Army from Space / a multitude of the Space Force"" appeared to shepherds, saying, “glory to God in the highest"". This makes it perfectly clear that aliens in God's military force from Space appeared to the shepherds to announce Jesus's birth.

If you do a similar search of Strong's Concordance for God's ""host of heaven"", seen in multiple places in the Bible Old Testament of the Bible, you will discover a similar result: In the original Hebrew language of the Old Testament the phrase translated into English as ""host of heaven"" means:

""Army from Space / Space Army / Space Force"".

So, the Bible's original Greek and Hebrew languages make it clear that God has alien Armies in Space. Therefore, you can deduce from another Bible account - - that the star-like object the wise men (dignitaries from an Eastern nation) followed, that stopped and hovered over Jesus's location after he was born - - was a UFO - - controlled by members of the same alien Army from Space who appeared to the shepherds. During the past 70 years thousands of people have reported seeing identical objects moving and hovering in the sky, that today we call UFOs.

Also the Bible's New Testament starting in Revelation 12: says:

""War broke out in heaven"".

As described previously, the word translated into English as ""heaven"" means ""Space"" in the original Greek text. So a more accurate translation is:

""War broke out in Space"".

Revelation goes on to say,

""Michael and his Angels fought with the dragon; and the dragon and his Angels fought, but they did not prevail, nor was a place found for them any longer in heaven \[Space\]. So the great dragon was cast out, that serpent of old, called the Devil and Satan, who deceives the whole world; he was cast to the earth, and his Angels were cast out with him.""

So this passage in Revelation 12 says that John saw a war in space between Satan's Aliens (“Angels”), and Michael's Aliens who the book of Daniel says is the Guardian of God’s people.

“Then I heard a loud voice saying in heaven \[Space\], 'Now salvation, and strength, and the kingdom of our God, and the power of His Christ have come, for the accuser of our brethren, who accused them before our God day and night, has been cast down. ... Therefore rejoice, O heavens, and you who dwell in them!"" \[This is one of the few places in the Bible where the original language text is translated correctly. Instead of translating it with the misleading word ""heaven"", as done practically everywhere else, it's translated more accurately here as ""heavens"". And everyone knows that ""heavens"" means ""Space"". So Revelation makes it crystal clear here that aliens live in space\].

""Therefore rejoice, O heavens \[Space\], and you who dwell in them! But woe to the inhabitants of the earth and the sea! For the devil has come

Down

to you

\[from Above the Earth in Space\],

having great wrath, because he knows that he has a short time.”

(Since the the book of Revelation of the Bible is basically about events that the author saw happening in the end time, he uses past tense, as if it already happened, since he already saw these future events happen. Therefore, his use of past tense in the above passage from Revelation doesn't imply that Satan and his fellow aliens had already been defeated in the space war and thrown down to Earth. To be consistent with the rest of Revelation this event should occur in the end time).

Revelation 12 makes it clear that there are both good and bad Aliens living in Space. This account from Revelation correlates with government insiders who said that there is war in space between different factions of Aliens. Multiple government insiders gave this information to the respected UFO researcher, Linda Moulton Howe. And government insiders gave similar information to Tom Delonge, In the interview on Fade to Black he was also told that the specific group of Aliens with ill will toward the Human Race instigating wars between nations are called ""The Bugs"": 

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzLqBx5lN8Y\](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzLqBx5lN8Y)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzLqBx5lN8Y](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzLqBx5lN8Y))

During this interview he also says that our government has learned about the role Consciousness plays in the interactions of the malicious aliens with the Human race. Its known that aliens can communicate thoughts and emotions via telepathy. Tom Delonge's government contacts told him its been discovered that the bad Aliens are repelled by Love; and Love counteracts their agenda. This correlates with with the teachings in the Christian New Testament part of the Bible, where Jesus's primary commandment to his followers is to

""❤️**Love one another**❤️"" Unconditionally,

and that

""❤️**God is Love**❤️"".

This correlates with what the government insiders told Tom Delonge that

\~ \~ \~ ❤️\*\*\***Love thwarts the evil agenda of ""The Bug**s"" \*\*\*❤️ \~ \~ \~",t2j02k,50,,1645947728.0,89,0.71

The easy finger would be at the religious segment of the human population, but I don't think religion has as much pull with modern culture as it used to. 

Unless there was ultimately a conspiracy that would negatively impact humans. And the government has to keep aliens themselves a secret in order to stop a major panic do to finding out that we are not alone and they wish us harm. 

In my opinion, if we are going to go with the mass panic route, there is definitely a malevolent aspect that is known by the government.

80,aliens,"Why legitimate UFO footage is guaranteed to be ""debunked"": probability is not common sense.","To demonstrate how easily probability can be misused, see [the prosecutor's fallacy.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosecutor%27s_fallacy)

>The prosecutor's fallacy is a fallacy of statistical reasoning involving a test for an occurrence, such as a DNA match. A positive result in the test may paradoxically be more likely to be an erroneous result than an actual occurrence, even if the test is very accurate. The fallacy is named because it is typically used by a prosecutor to exaggerate the probability of a criminal defendant's guilt. The fallacy can be used to support other claims as well – including the innocence of a defendant.

>For instance, if a perpetrator were known to have the same blood type as a given defendant and 10% of the population to share that blood type, then one version of the prosecutor's fallacy would be to claim that, on that basis alone, the probability that the defendant is guilty is 90%. However, this conclusion is only close to correct if the defendant was selected as the main suspect based on robust evidence discovered prior to the blood test and unrelated to it (the blood match may then be an ""unexpected coincidence""). Otherwise, the reasoning presented is flawed, as it overlooks the high prior probability (that is, prior to the blood test) that he is a random innocent person. Assume, for instance, that 1000 people live in the town where the murder occurred. This means that 100 people live there who have the perpetrator's blood type; therefore, the true probability that the defendant is guilty – based on the fact that his blood type matches that of the killer – is only 1%, far less than the 90% argued by the prosecutor. 

A UFO photograph or video is often considered to be debunked if at least one unlikely coincidence is found in the case. You only need one. We now know that the Flir1 Nimitz UFO footage is authentic because the government admitted it was, but this footage was leaked in 2007 with skeptics [concluding that it was a CGI hoax because it was originally uploaded to a CGI website.](https://www.abovetopsecret.com/forum/thread265835/pg1) What are the odds of legitimate Navy footage being first uploaded to a CGI website? This demonstrates that even if you have a very strong coincidence argument against UFO footage, it could still be perfectly legitimate. 

There are other kinds of coincidences that are used in the same way. What if the UFO resembles a man made object? Does that mean that it's probably a hoax? Actually, no. I'll explain this critical error using the McMinnville UFO photographs. They are often considered to be a hoax because the UFO resembles a vehicle side view mirror from that era. What are the odds that a UFO would closely resemble a side view mirror? That's not actually what the argument is, however. It's actually ""what are the odds that *any* of a number of unlikely coincidences in the case would be found?"" This is because if an unlikely coincidence was found, it would be considered to be debunked. It just happens to be in this case that skeptics discovered the resemblance to a man made object, but many other kinds of coincidences could have taken its place. 

In [this debunking of the MnMinnville UFO](https://np.reddit.com/r/UFOs/comments/820q0p/this_is_what_solidifies_in_my_mind_that_the/), they didn't use the highest quality version of the photograph, so it only *appears* to be a very close match. However, we should expect to find at least one man made object that resembles the ufo, but that doesn't actually mean anything for guilt or innocence. 

What is the total number of things humans have created? Billions? Trillions? We have created an uncountable number of things of all shapes, colors, and sizes, and each of them can be photographed from a wide variety of angles, including various kinds of toys, kites, balloons, vehicle parts, trinkets, cookware, utensils, tools, hats, etc, etc. Unless the UFO is of a very unusual shape, it's nearly guaranteed that you'll eventually discover a man made object that resembles a UFO. 

What about hobbies and occupations? Even though many people out there work in special effects and are equally likely to see a UFO as anyone else, if a UFO photograph happened to be taken by such a person, it will be automatically discredited. What are the odds that a UFO witness will happen to work in special effects? Like earlier, this is not what the argument actually is because other occupations and hobbies have been used to discredit a UFO photograph or video. Any other kind of unlikely coincidence could be used here. 

People who are automatically suspicious of perpetrating a UFO hoax: 1) anyone who has a drone, 2) anyone who builds scale models, 3) anyone who has a hobby or occupation involving VFX, 4) anyone who has a hobby or occupation involving special effects, 5) anyone with a youtube account or something else that may theoretically draw subscribers or money from the sighting, 6) anyone who has seen a UFO more than once, and 7) anyone with a conviction on their record. I know I'm missing a lot here, but you get the point. **Additionally**, even if the witness had no occupations or hobbies having anything to do with these things, and even if this is the first UFO this person has witnessed, it can still be ""debunked"" if a skeptic finds a man made object that closely resembles the UFO. At the end of the day, the likelihood of a legitimate UFO witness passing the ""no coincidence test"" is low because there are so many available options to choose from. You should expect to find at least one unlikely coincidence in the case, sometimes more.

The 2007 Costa Rica video has been ""debunked"" because it was found that the primary witness builds scale models of horse drawn carriages and stuff as a hobby, alleging that he could have also built a UFO model based on this coincidence. Here is the [Costa Rica 2007 UFO video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obVsLOiqeC4). Here are [screenshots](https://imgur.com/a/XjkwzPq) of the video, and here's a [gif](https://i.imgur.com/oJBoUBY.gif) of the movement. [Here is a video on his scale models](https://www.repretel.com/noticia/el-taxista-ebanista-de-san-ignacio-de-acosta/), and here is a photo he took of one of his [scale models](https://scontent.fmel12-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.6435-9/84470991_2286705304762378_3541000205392412672_n.jpg?_nc_cat=110&ccb=1-5&_nc_sid=8bfeb9&_nc_ohc=_n3dLcwDuv4AX89f_Aj&_nc_ht=scontent.fmel12-1.fna&oh=4830d1874d020bd83f7fb3b417edbb95&oe=6196DF91) What are the odds? 

[This video of a flying saucer zipping around outside of an airplane window](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhCiRwyJLI8) was debunked because the witness who posted the video was accused of being a hoaxer. She works in special effects (not VFX) and worked on a couple of alien themed movies. She was widely accused of being a hoaxer and eventually deleted her original tweet. What are the odds that a UFO witness would work in special effects on a few alien movies? I would change this to ""what are the odds that you'd find at least one unlikely coincidence in a UFO case?"" It could very well be CGI, but the fact that you found an unlikely coincidence doesn't support that allegation.

The bottom line is that you are not asking how unlikely it is that a person who films a UFO would work in special effects or that the UFO resembles a specific man made object. Your actual argument is ""what are the odds that I would be able to find at least one unlikely coincidence in a legitimate UFO case?"" The answer is that it's practically guaranteed because coincidences happen all the time, so when you do finally stumble upon that coincidence, that by itself is not evidence of anything whatsoever. If enough details are made public, someone will eventually discover that coincidence. 

Here are two more critical errors I've seen made many times on the subject of UFOs: 

**1)** Just because something is possibly true does not mean it is actually true. Just because it is possible to recreate a UFO photograph using camera trickery does not mean that the photo is a fake. Possibility here does not imply likelihood because many real things can be recreated using camera trickery. Think about real things being depicted on a Hollywood set, such as gun fights, car crashes, etc. 

This argument is also often based on the idea that extraterrestrial visitation is unlikely, meaning that if it is theoretically possible to recreate a UFO photograph, then it must have been fake, but [we don't actually know how likely or unlikely alien visitation is.](https://np.reddit.com/r/HighStrangeness/comments/s77z1n/out_of_the_many_myths_about_ufos_perhaps_the_most/) 

**2)** Just because there are many cases of conventional objects being misinterpreted as UFOs does not imply that all UFOs are conventional. If alien spaceships really were visiting Earth and the public was aware of this, the majority of sightings would still be conventional phenomena because most people are not expertly familiar with aircraft, atmospheric physics, astronomy, etc. A sampling of reports from the general public would still be mostly conventional, not actual UFOs, whether UFOs were real or not.",t1xuq4,100,,1645884344.0,27,0.94

About a month before Covid-19 hit, so sometime in February 2020, I woke up in the middle of the night while asleep on my bed. I don’t know why I woke up all of a sudden, I usually sleep for a full 8 hours, but I was sleeping on my right side and I felt a weight on the bottom right corner of my bed. I didn’t turn over though, I felt a bit scared and I can’t explain why, I was just too scared to turn over. About 5 seconds after I woke up, the weight at the bottom right corner of my bed started to lay down next to me, as if it was very flexible like some snake, like a cobra was descending back down to the ground. I remember closing my eyes and I slowed my breath to as quite as it could go because I felt like whatever this was may think I’m still sleeping. 

I was lying down on my right side and the weight I could feel on the mattress was like someone was lying next to me, and then I heard a clear voice whisper in my ear, “just die”. It whispered it quietly and then the weight next to me/behind me started elevating itself off my bed, and I couldn’t feel it anymore after about 5 seconds. I remember being scared still, so I kept my eyes closed and my body still for another 10-15 seconds, maybe for a shorter or longer amount of time. I then violently pushed myself off my bed as I thought something might still be there and I felt like I had to be ready to fight some robber, but nobody was there. I went to my washroom and stayed in there for over half an hour because I didn’t feel it was safe to go back to my bed. I remember I was hoping whatever I felt/heard was gone. I was able to fall asleep again about an hour later. 

I don’t know what else to type really. I don’t have anything physical or visual so I don’t know how to provide evidence or proof of this. I can definitely answer anyone’s questions though. I don’t know if anything like this has happened to anyone else. I looked at sleep paralysis and I am very doubtful this was sleep paralysis because I never felt like trying to get up nor did I feel I had any weight on me, and apparently people don’t here voice(s).",t0u20r,23,,1645760874.0,14,0.87

The claims that Robert Dean made truly have the potential to turn the world as we know it on its head. No one can doubt his credibility, he worked at NATO headquarters from 1963 to 1967. He enrolled in the United States Army on April 5, 1960, and has also served in Korea as well as Vietnam. On October 31, 1976, he retired from the army as a Command Sergeant Major.

Robert Dean first came to the forefront of controversy with his claims that he saw a secret document labeled as ""UFO Assessment: An Evaluation of a Possible Threat."" Dean claimed that the document detailed secret information on alien autopsies, extraterrestrial encounters, and UFO sightings. He stated that the research was approved by NATO.

Following an impressive 28-year military career, he decided to reveal the hidden information on July 5 at the Roswell 50th anniversary celebration.

100,aliens,New information - story about a Chinese farmer kidnapped from an alien planet for a month.,"*Note: This post seems to be incorrectly posted in* r/ufos*, so the same post in* r/ufos *has been removed.*

*To make it easier to read. I have integrated some content from the old post. And by accident, covered the old post with the new content. So you don't need to read the old post at all. Of course, some of the old post content was lost. I don't have a backup, so I can't restore it.*

A few days ago, I posted a story about an Anhui farmer who was abducted to an alien planet. Quite a few people were interested. Yesterday I read the story of *Adventures on the Alien Planet Gok in 1985* in its entirety. There are some new discoveries. Now add a little. Hope you will like it.

In general, I found the story is enlightening. There are a lot of new ideas. The logical explanation of the reasons for many of the aliens' strange behavior.

There is also a lot of physics. I am not an expert in physics. So it's not good to comment.

## The Alien Mass-energy Formula

Alien scientists explained to,

>""Your momentum on Earth is mass multiplied by velocity; our concept of momentum on the planet Gok is the vector speed of light minus the velocity of the object's motion multiplied by its mass. The direction of the vector speed of light can change.  
>  
>""Why does our concept of momentum have an additional vector speed of light than Earth concept of momentum? You earthlings do not realize that the space around an object is always moving at the vector speed of light in all directions.

## Alien Scientist Teaches Unified Field Formula

>""Taking the derivative of this momentum equation with respect to time (a direct translation of their words is to find the variables) yields 4 forces, the first is the change in mass over time multiplied by the vector speed of light, this electric field force, the second is the force of the mass of the object over time multiplied by the speed of motion, this is the magnetic field force, the third is the force of the vector speed of light over time multiplied by the mass, this is the nuclear force, and the fourth is the force of the speed of motion over time multiplied by the mass, this force is the universal force of gravity and the inertial force of your Newtonian mechanics.  
>  
>""This is the grand unified equation that your earthly scientist Albert Einstein struggled to write the 4 forces of the universe in one equation. He worked hard for decades without success.""

## What is Time?

Alien scientists explained to,

>""Time is just the feeling given by the light-speed emission motion of space around a person. Without human, there would be no time.  
>  
>""The core secret of the universe is actually hidden in space, the essence of the field is the space of movement, so it can also be said that the core secret of the universe is hidden in the field.  
>  
>""Any object in the universe, including our body as an observer, with the space around the object as the center, with the speed of light to disperse the movement around. This motion of space gives us, as observers, a sense of time.

## The principle of UFO flight

Zhang introduced that UFOs (flying saucers) use anti-mass field engines. It can reduce the mass of the UFO to zero or very small, so the UFO can run at the speed of light. Since the passenger mass is zero, the acceleration felt is also zero. they will not be killed by acceleration.

Spacecraft can travel at the speed of light. It can reach any corner of the universe instantly without consuming time. Because at the speed of light, the distance ahead has been compressed to zero. But a trip usually takes several hours because the reduction to zero mass takes time to get into and out of the speed of light.

The principle of the engine is not very complicated. It is a ring-shaped particle gas pedal that uses high-speed spinning particles to create an anti-mass field.

The spacecraft cannot carry much energy. It relies on an external power source from the base to obtain its initial state at takeoff and consumes very little energy during flight.

## The structure of the UFO

On the outside is a torus and on the inside is a tube for particle acceleration. In the center of the spacecraft is a cylindrical tube that seems to be where the fuel (a kind of particles) and the engine are stored. The passengers stay in the middle annular area. The diameter of the ring area (segment) is about ten meters, which is still relatively spacious. It is a small flying saucer.

Due to the zero mass, the dust of interstellar space does not damage the spacecraft. But if the volume is too large, like a planet, it can cause damage to the machine. So they need computers to plan their route.

In short, their spacecraft are not invulnerable.

The aliens explained that their spacecraft could also have accidents. But certain more advanced alien civilizations have ships that can do so with zero accidents.

## The principle of flying in the atmosphere

Reach the planet's atmosphere, ship well slight increase a bit weight. Floating in the air. When it needs to move on the planet, reduce its mass to zero in a very short period, travel a short distance at the speed of light, and then exit. Repeat over and over again. In this way, the flying saucer can move on planet at less than the speed of light, but at a very high speed and with amazing maneuverability.

## UFOs can reach tens of light-years away in a few hours

The aliens explain that time is a relative concept. They depart from within an artificial field that alters the speed of time passing locally. So a round trip to explore other planets takes only a few hours, not decades.

## No interstellar wars between advanced alien civilizations

The aliens explain that advanced alien civilizations are extremely productive. They can easily convert matter, and they are not interested in plundering material resources. They will have some intellectual competitions(mathematics), but they will not fight and kill each other as the Earthlings do.

## Alien's artificial field technology

The aliens seem to have mastered an artificial field technology manipulating space. This technology is very powerful and is the basis of alien civilization. Space can be used to calculate, store, and analyze information. That it can perform amazing functions such as teleporting objects, recording information from the brain without loss, physical construction, and communication without delay.

## Aliens can live forever

Aliens use artificial field technology to record human consciousness. It is then installed in artificially bred body mentions to achieve immortality.

The largest industry on their planet is the manufacture of bodies.

They study the bodies of various races. If you like, you can change one. But earthlings cannot be replaced. They explained that alien species have not been studied to replace their bodies. Maybe some research institutes have.

The aliens showed him many types of bodies. Different materials, combinations of different species. It was also said that most of them would be eliminated, and only a few might become popular.

Zhang said to the alien, ""There can't be two of me in the universe. Your replicated human bodies cannot be considered original humans. When people arrive at your human replication factory, they are actually killed and burned by you, and then a random person comes out and says, 'The human body has been replicated successfully!'""

The alien seemed outraged by this comment. But the alien put a helmet-like device on him. He experiences two consciousnesses alternating in different places simultaneously, and the total experience time is twice as long as the actual time. Hence, he believes the alien's immortality technology is real.

## How long will it take for Earth to develop immortality technology?

Alien scientists explained to,

>""One is a matter of confidence. If you earthlings have this confidence, understand that the core of human is the consciousness, and the consciousness is just the form of movement of charged particles in the human brain, which belongs to information. If you earthlings have mastered the scanning technology of artificial fields, it only takes a few decades to do it,"" Gapon replied....""However, the most crucial thing is that you earthlings have to know what the nature of the field is. Only after mastering the nature of the field, you can use the field to penetrate deep inside the human brain and record the information of human consciousness....""It's also important to recognize that the direction of the problem,"" Norton said.  
>  
>""At the core of the human being is the consciousness of the mind. Thought-consciousness activity can create perturbations in the surrounding space, causing it to fluctuate, which is space itself. The speed of fluctuation is the speed of light. It is just as important to record the fluctuating forms of space as recording the forms of motion of charged particles in the human brain.

## Life on Earth began on land

The alien scientist told him that you Earthling scientists say that life on Earth originated in the oceans. This is wrong. Life on Earth originated on land a billion years ago. In small pools of water on land, to be exact. The environment of the ocean was not suitable for the evolution of primitive life.

## All aliens characteristics are not very different from human

Alien scientists say that the appearance of all terrestrial evolved intelligent life is not very different from that of Earthlings. Because this is the optimal solution for the evolution of life.

## Death does not exist

The alien scientists told him that the earthlings do not have the technology for immortality now. But death does not exist. Because the soul is the information, the fluctuation of space. All movements in the universe are repeatedly and constantly unfolding. Unfolding all the possibilities. That is why death does not exist. People will keep reincarnating, but they will lose the memories of their previous lives. Because memories are stored in the physical body.

## Why did the aliens abduct him?

He claims to have been abducted at the age of 19. The aliens thought he was young and strong. It seems to be used to improve their entertainment program. The details, which Zhang did not write very specifically due to Chinese legal restrictions against publication.

In my opinion, this may explain why aliens like to appear in America: maybe because Americans are physically strong and like to exercise, or they like the American look. Maybe aliens come to Earth mostly without any big purpose, just to abduct a few girls/boys to get some fun, as hooligans.

The book introduces a virtual game about Earthlings on the planet Gok. The Americans are described as Hercules, with strong upper bodies and legs like steel forks.In this game, the Japanese are described as enjoying killing people, both foreigners and their own people.The Chinese, on the other hand, are described as having dreadlocks. Like to chop off heads.Europeans are described as philosophers with pipes.

## What happens to abducted Earthlings

Not every abducted Earthling is sent back. Some never make it back.

>""Some were sent back; some were not physically strong and died on the spot while doing experiments; some could not stand the abuse of our women and died; some were abandoned and left to fend for themselves on our planet ... Why? you may ask,"" Santos shook his head and said with a smile, ""Because we are lazy too!""

But the aliens assured him that they would send him back to Earth because Chang was of special value.

## Will aliens help humans?

Some aliens will help humans pass, but not on a large scale. Just as the Americans will not help Africa on a large scale. Aliens don't care about human society; they just come to Earth to find what is useful.

They also have no love for us Earthlings, but they also have no intention of harming Earthlings.

They had more contact with Earthlings to guide their development in ancient times. The aliens do not want to pass on their technology to the Earthlings now because they believe that the level of technology of the Earthlings is not very different from their current level of technology, and they fear that it would not be in their interest to make the Earthlings too powerful.

The aliens are reluctant to contact the Earthlings directly, mainly because they are worried that the Earthlings will endlessly ask them for scientific theories and technology. It's like when you visit a primitive tribe, the shorts might disappear.

If the Earthlings go too far, they might occasionally help. They claim to have stopped Germany from developing the atomic bomb, but they don't say how.

If Earthlings are facing extinction and can easily solve it, they may help Earthlings because Earthlings have a lot of research value. They are unlikely to help Earthlings if they require enormous resources and burden them greatly.

Generally speaking, they are arrogant to the Earthlings.

They also abducted some people from advanced planets, but they were treated much better than the Earthlings because they were afraid of retaliation.

## Are Aliens Moral?

No. Most aliens have nothing to do but have fun all day. Morality is in some ways worse than earthlings - in fact, according to his description, the aliens seem to be lecherous and sexually abusive.

One thing, though, is that because technology is so advanced, most goods and services are free. Very few aliens are working and researching. So, they have abundant resources, and they don't need to fight for money. Therefore, they do not like to fight and kill like Earthlings do.

## Are Aliens Smart?

Like earthlings, aliens are severely polarized in terms of intelligence, some are very smart, and some are very stupid.

Zhang asked them, ""Your planet is very advanced, the technology is amazing, and the people on your planet are very smart, right?""

""No, a few of us are indeed smart, most of us are ordinary, and many others are stupid, even more, stupid than you Earthlings. The development of our planet is because a few smart people prevailed and became the mainstream of society. If the opposite happens, the result is quite bad. Society develops, smart people become smarter, stupid people become dumber, and not all people become smart.""

## What do aliens look like?

Many kinds. He claims to have seen the aliens were short, with smooth, pale pink skin, but with a hard bite inside.

About 1 meter tall; pinkish-white skin; no visible bones; thick hands; very smooth skin; large eyes with deep sockets; very thin waists and exaggerated over-curves with the hips in women; women's breasts that bulge like horns; skin that can change color depending on mood; clothes that look like they are painted on; their bodies are made with cloning technology and can be changed at any time; women's hair looks like curly tubes; men's hair sticks to their scalp like a piece of rubber; small noses and ears; more protruding mouths; and faces that lack dimensionality.

## Alien Politics

Alien planets have no leaders, no countries. It is negotiated and managed by experts in various fields. Sort of like academic organizations on Earth, and with computers and algorithms to assist. According to him, computers and algorithms are even the main decision-makers.

## Policing on the alien planet

He said that field control technology is widely used on the alien planet, and there is a system called Global Motion Network that monitors and protects everyone at all times and violent crimes are impossible.

## Alien Money

Most alien goods and services are free. But money doesn't go away. Everyone has access to a certain amount of virtual currency regularly. They personally spend money mainly to get services from others.

They also say that money has not disappeared even in more advanced alien civilization societies.

So if you want to live a more exciting life. You also need to try to earn money. But most of their planet's products and services are free. It's not easy to make more money.

## Alien Fashion

Compared to Earth, aliens have relatively simple clothing. Almost every alien has a virtual imageboard in the back of their head that shows some image or character that does nothing but make them look cool. (I think this should be called 3D physical emotion icon)

## Is the Universe Full of Life?

The aliens answer that there is life on many planets, but mostly simple viruses or bacteria, and not much advanced intelligent life like Earth. Less than one has advanced lifeforms of the 100 million planets with life.

## Aliens don't have Families.

They have no family, no parents, no brothers, and sisters, but they have partners.

Their people are very selfish. Even if they are close partners, many of them do not live together and are too lazy to serve each other. They rarely have permanent partners. They usually last for a while and tend to break up.

Of course, not all of them don't have families. There are some natural people in their primary star, but only a few.

## Alien Computer Technology

Computers on Earth use electrons as carriers, and while electronic computers are slow due to Coulomb forces, an alien computer uses a vacuum as a carrier. It runs much faster than the computers on Earth.

## Alien Sexuality

From an Earthling perspective, alien sexuality is rampant, pervert, violent, cruel, and aggressive.

They are popular remote virtual sex more than real sex. Or virtual reality sex.

Many of them hijack earthlings to be virtual playmates. They force you to perform various actions while scanning various data that is very valuable to them. From this data, they create virtual playmates.

They use colloidal material to create virtual people, and when the material is filled with data, they become lifelike virtual people. They use the same data set to create thousands of virtual playmates to satisfy the curious needs of alien men and women.

They say that in material wealth they have no interest, coupled with immortality. So they spend 99% of their time seeking new experiences and sensual stimulation.

## How Many People are on Their Planet?

Tens of billions of people. There are also many pets and virtual people of all kinds. Far more than on Earth. And this is just the population of his home planet. Many other planets with large populations nearby, and the total number could be very large. Zhang did not ask how many people were nearby.

## Will Aliens Make Formal Contact with Earth?

There is a default rule in the universe where they say that once a civilization has a light-speed ship, they will initiate contact. Because spaceships with the speed of light can travel everywhere, it is best to make contact and establish a relationship early.

## The Universe is like an Onion

The universe seems infinite in space, and galaxies and planets can still be found in the trillions of light-years that aliens have explored. Layer after layer, each layer is separated by a very distant space. Even alien exploration of outer space is limited. The same is true of the microscopic world. Nor can aliens answer what the outermost universe is like.

Even though alien flying saucers can reach any corner of the universe instantly, aliens still cannot find the edge of the universe. Therefore, they believe that the universe seems to be infinite.

## Mind Control

They are proficient in mind-control technology. They scan and alter the minds and memories of those around them, which is their weapon. They change the minds of those who are aggressive towards them.

## They don't need to Eat

They don't eat; Zhang says they rely on artificial fields to transmit nutrients to their bodies, so they don't need to eat like Earthlings. Occasionally, they drink some liquid beverages.

""We don't need to eat,"" the aliens say, ""and our teeth may degrade, but eating should be no problem.""

## Are there Aliens on Earth?

Yes, there are. But not in large numbers. And there are more than one kind of aliens. They use at least two techniques to disguise themselves on Earth.

1. they infiltrate some earthlings with an intelligent metallic liquid and replace it with their own consciousness.When their bodies age, they repeat the same trick. The old earthlings will become vegetative.
2. They artificially create a earthlings body on their planet and put their own consciousness on it.

## Is Earth a technologically backward planet?

The aliens say that Earth technology is obviously backward compared to them. But it is more advanced than most planets with civilizations.

103,aliens,Offering my own Alien Abduction and Telepathic ET Contact Stories offered as Dreams Stories,"Hello Friends,

I'm feeling prompted to share my experience with Aliens, Alien Abduction, and ET Contact. I'm not asking anyone to believe me, nor do I think my stories here serve as proof.  I've had the rather uncomfortable experience of having very real feeling ET dreams that sometimes feel like Alien Abduction but there's no actual proof in the physical it happened.  

I guess I'm sharing it because it is helpful for me to read other's stories and they helped me realize what was going on, so I hope that my stories can help other people relate to their own dreams and extraordinary experiences.

Here is a link to a Youtube video I made telling these stories: [https://youtu.be/hWeBfyJ7KNI](https://youtu.be/hWeBfyJ7KNI)

**TLDR**

I was abducted by aliens at around the age 4, 14, and19.  The ETs and I kept in contact through dreams in ways I didn't understand until I realized that the reality of my being is fundamentally consciousness. I realize now that I wasn't actually abducted, but had true experiences of ET contact. 

I want others to know there are more options than the stereotypical abduction pattern.  These involve an openness to experience outside of the consensus worldview.

&#x200B;

**Disclaimer: These stories are like dreams, not historically documentable events**

All my stories and thoughts are shared here like dreams.  Whenever I work with these stories and memories, I use a process similar to dream interpretation and I do not make claims of historical events beyond the fact that I had dreams, memories, and inner experiences.

&#x200B;

**A note about the term Alien Abduction**

I actual prefer the term ET Contact, even though I've had many of the experiences related to Alien Abduction.  The reason why I say this is that I don't actually have memories of being taken without consent, which is the definition of abduction.  I do remember terrifying experiences, I do remember being scared to fall sleep, I do remember learning about Alien Abduction and realized I experienced something like it.  I also have undergone hypnotic regressions and have had flashbacks.

I worked with the idea of Alien Abduction when I didn't have all the puzzle pieces I do now.  It's like I had these memories and fears that looked like what the media said was abduction, so I figured that's what it must have been.  It took me years to feel comfortable enough to go into the memories through regression hypnosis.  

Anyways, I understand that Alien Abduction is very very real, but that I had something like it but different.  I wish I knew that there were other options than genetic harvest or alien experiments against my consent.

&#x200B;

**Earliest Alien Abduction Memories - Around 3-4 years old**

*The Vampires*

I have two definite and physical memories that I keep coming back to.  The first memory is of being terrified of my closet.  I knew that beings came out of it to ""get me"".  That maybe if I hid under the covers and never actually saw them, I would be safe.

I don't actually have physical memories of seeing them, but I do remember my memories of them.  In my mind, they were ""vampires"".  It wasn't because they sucked blood, but they reminded me of the Count from Sesame Street.  They were short and spindly,  they had big foreheads, dark eyes, and pointed chins.  They didn't have ears or hair.

*The Easter Bunny*

The second memory is a physical memory. My mom put a rainbow sticker on my window that I could look at when I got scared.  I was looking at it and out the window and I saw something come to the house.  It was definitely something, but I couldn't make it out.  It sort of shifted and shimmered.  It felt like there was a lot of gravity behind it.  It walked from the street to the house.

I remember looking at it and not knowing what it was.  It wasn't like anything I ever had seen before.  I went through a couple different ideas and realized it was probably the Easter Bunny.  As soon as I thought that, it sort of shifted, like it was coming into focus and I could see it as the Easter Bunny.  It was the weirdest thing because I had two levels of perception.  One was of the shimmery nothing and one was a very agreeable image of the Easter Bunny.  It's sort of like how there's two consciousnesses in dream, one of the body  just lying there and one of the dream story.

I don't remember what happened next.  The next thing I do remember is the next day.  I told my family about seeing the Easter Bunny, they all humored me but I could tell they didn't believe me.  I asked my family what they remember and they do remember me talking about it and were puzzled why I was so insistent about such a silly lie.  My brother realized that I may have had an experience because he observed it was out of my character to play with lies like that.

&#x200B;

**Teenage Suspicions and Dreams**

*Abduction symptoms*

The next major period of contact in my life was my teenage years.  I'd say it was around 14 years old.  I don't actually have physical memories of the experiences.  I do have memories of trying to figure out my own experience, I remember pouring through my library's sections about UFOs, spirituality, and religion.  

I experienced several strange shifts in my life during this time. I became a vegetarian.  I became obsessed with the scarab beetle and the Ra mythologies. I started having very intense dreams.  I remember being terrified to sleep.  I became obsessed with stories of aliens, crop circles, cryptids, and these things.  I remember scouring my body for abduction marks.

*My parents saw a UFO*

My parents did see a UFO visit the house.  My dad talked about it until he realized no one believed him and it was hurting his credibility.  They said that the UFO came from over Lake Superior, flew up and down the beach, then straight to our house, and then zipped away.

*Strange Dreams and Reptilian Contact*

I had a LOT of dreams that were intense and strange, which is why I ended up studying dreams and psychology.  They were lucid and strange and potent.  There were some major dream characters, like a reptilian being who would visit me.  That series of dreams with the reptilian were some of the most real feeling dreams and ended in a sort of torture experience.  Many of these dreams read like screen memories to me.

&#x200B;

**Road Trip at 19 Years Old**

I had an experience that my twin brother remembers too. We were 19 and driving to California from Michigan. We pass through Minneapolis and stop by a restaurant to make a phone call (from a pay phone). The whole place was a like a psychedelic dinner, like it was from the 50s and then went through the 60s with a bunch of LSD. This is important because of the ""screen memories"" we decided worked for us.

Anyways, we make the call, then get back into the car and start driving out of the city. The next thing I remember is we're driving in the plains, like there was zero transition from city to highway, there was no suburbs or anything. I was super out of it, I could barely keep my head up. All I remember is driving through a construction zone at night for what feels like hours. There's this flashing and all this light, like they put up those barrels and cones and they're so so so bright.

Anyways, my brother and I realize something is going on and we telepathically communicate that we need to keep going and get out of wherever we are. It feels weird and we just need to keep going. After what feels like forever, we get out of it, like leaving a bubble. As we left that space, he sees what he calls a ""witch/dog"", its both a witch and a dog.

We don't know what's going on at all, but we keep going until a rest area, pull off and gather ourselves. We get back on the road and talk about it. We figure that we were drugged in the restaurant, that someone must have put LSD on the phone because it was such a trippy place.

We decide that that is a good enough explanation and we never talked about it again till last year. I'm super into ET contact and abductions and I work as a hypnotist and I have a client that comes in about missing time and a weird screen memory about driving outside of a city then having a vision of a dog. The client, by the way, has the name of the city my brother is living in, that's such a strange coincidence. Anyways, I remember all of a sudden my experience.

I called my brother and asked, ""what do you remember about driving outside of Minneapolis?"" Just that, nothing more. He goes, ""OMG! holy smokes, I remember something so crazy..."" then relates the experience.

Anyways, this happened at night, but we were driving and so we definitely weren't sleeping. It has the feeling of screen memory and ET contact, but there's no evidence for abduction, its just stories and memories at this point.

&#x200B;

**Telepathic Contact through a Cuttlefish**

When I was around 24 years old, I started seriously practicing meditation and out of body or astral projection.  I encountered many beings in those states.  That's a whole other post :) I had physical, real life experience around that time too.  It reminds me a lot of the construction zone that kept going from my experience when I was 19.

I visited the National Aquarium in DC.  I walked around and found that the Jellyfish exhibit was completely empty of people, so I decided to walk slowly and to tune into their vibe.  I keep walking and go through this sort of labyrinths of rooms will jellyfish, turning this way and that way.  I was pretty lost, but I like getting lost in museums, no one was there, and I didn't have anything else to do, so it was great.

All of a sudden, I'm in this room with a cuttlefish floating at eye level in its tank.  I realize that it is an intelligent being and that it can communicate through its flashing.  I go over to be with it and tune into its vibe.  We make eye contact.  It flashes its lights.  We stay in what I later called ""telepathic communion"".

After the experience, I ended up telling people that I had a telepathic communion experience with a cuttlefish.  It sounded crazy and there really wasn't anything to verbally or conceptually say about it except that it happened and that there definitely was a communication, but I couldn't tell you exactly what it said.

I stopped talking about it, but wrote and illustrated a book about the experience.  The little book took maybe 60 hours of work, which I'm sharing because it shows to the power of this experience on my life, even if I couldn't say exactly what it meant.  It has to do with Sumerian mythology and has themes somewhat relevant to the ET/Human history themes that emerge from contact. You can read it here: [https://cosmicdreamsanctuary.org/mystery-of-babylon/](https://cosmicdreamsanctuary.org/mystery-of-babylon/).

I wrote and illustrated several more books based on the same telepathic source.  These inspiration for the books were downloaded and had the same feeling to me.  They are much more clear in their message and you can read them here: [https://cosmicdreamsanctuary.org/message/](https://cosmicdreamsanctuary.org/message/)

&#x200B;

**Dream Contact in my 20s and 30s**

I had many dreams about the nature of the world and contact with ETs.  Every few years, I'd get curious again about ETs and I'd start lucid dreaming practices to explore.  They'd go great for a few dreams, then it got real.  Whenever I reached out, they would reach back and it freaked me out.

There would be dream contact and it made sense to me.  Then there would be events or omens in my waking life that had definite reference to those experiences.  You might call these synchronicities.  It freaked me out because I enjoyed the distance from the actual contact experience.  I didn't really want ETs to be real in my life, I preferred them as memories or interesting party conversation, not as revealers of a different order of reality that is breaking into my own reality.

After a few potent experiences, I'd slow it down.  I'd stop dreaming and stop reaching out.  They stopped reaching back.  I'd live my normal life in a sane and acceptable way.  Then I'd try it again, freak out, and shut down.

&#x200B;

**CE-5 Experiences and Diving into Contact in my later 30s**

I eventually came to terms with all my experiences and freak out.  I actually needed to.  My normal life involved being a web developer, which I was good but knew it wasn't my vocation.  I just got sick of the back and forth.  I looked at my training and experience and realized I wanted to work with ET contact and consciousness.  For example, I got a MA in psychology and a handful of certificates in psycho-spiritual work, but the closest training I actually had in web development was an internship and I dropped out of night school for product management.

I actually prayed to myself and whatever is out there that I listen to my vocation and dive into working with dreams, hypnosis, and ET contact.  I immediately heard guidance to google CE-5 Revelstoke and follow what's there. I talk about the experience on the Connect the Dots podcast here: [https://anchor.fm/connectthedot/episodes/Look-at-us--listen-to-him-with-Daniel-Rekshan-e10gvr0](https://anchor.fm/connectthedot/episodes/Look-at-us--listen-to-him-with-Daniel-Rekshan-e10gvr0)

By following that guidance, I got connected with CE-5 and people who practice it.  Turns out, I was practicing something like that for years with my dream contact, I just didn't know it was a thing.  All those concepts really helped me normalize my experiences and to make sense of them.

&#x200B;

**Making Sense of It All Now**

I know understand my experiences in context of consciousness.  That the abductions may have been physical events, but they were also conscious events.  I understand that my conscious mind is actually a very small layer of my own mind and that I am much more vast that was I think.  In that way, I understand the ET contact experience to involve aspects of consciousness that are impossible to hold in the physicalized, egoic, conceptual, or everyday state of consciousness.

I am a hypnotist and I work with other hypnotists for my own regressions.  They do not reveal physical memories alone and I am very emphatic that the hypnotic regression state is not about recovering physical memories, but needs to be interpreted something like a dream.

*The Telepathic Grey - Dream Contact*

I asked my dreams what happened when I was 14.  I had a dream that night about being on a small craft.  I was in a sort of loading dock of a UFO.  There was a room with something like a one-way mirror.  I could feel the presence of the Greys behind the window.  There were medical devices all around.

I was sitting on a bed with a very kind and gentle human.  It felt like we were debriefing.  I tuned into the human in my dream and realized it was a projection.  He was the one in charge of relating to humans. The being was actually a Gray setting up the screen memories or posthypnotic suggestions.  The other Grays were not malevolent, but didn't have the training or empathy to effectively relate to humans without freaking them out. I could physically see the Gray, but my mind choose to align with his invitation to see a kind human.  It felt very much like the Easter Bunny experience.

In the dream experience, not the experience when I was 14, the Gray explained to me how all this works.  He let me know that I was strong and flexible enough to understand that telepathy is real and that much of the contact is directly perceived by the human, but the mind chooses to align with invitations for dream-like memories because it is easier.  He let me know that contact, especially telepathic contact, can happen outside of time and that we could continue our conversations should I desire.

*The Reptilian Dreamer - Regression Memory*

I became curious about my sudden shift of behavior when I was 14, the UFO my parents saw, and the Reptilian dreams.  I was actually very curious because I had become obsessed with the MILAB information.  I had this overwhelming intuition that I had a MILAB experience then and I was actually very scared to do the regression.  I realized that I needed to have integrity as a hypnotist because that's exactly what I was inviting people to do.  I ended up making a self-hypnosis audio track and went into the memory.

In the regression, I found myself strapped to a medical bed in what looked like a hospital or lab room.  I saw a half dozen military and medical technicians. When I looked down at my body, I saw from the eyes of a large Reptilian being.

As soon as I asked how it was possible and what was going on, I received a very clear message.  The Reptilian was working with the military underneath KI Sawyer Air Force Base.  It engaged in a sort of telepathic monitoring of the region through dreams and other means.  It saw the UFO visit my house and realized that I was a contactee and wanted to use a consciousness-abduction technique.  I experienced it as the dream of torture by the Reptilian.

It let me know that as it used its own consciousness to abduct mine, something happened.  It gets really strange here.  He said that we were from the same initial seed of consciousness in this universe and that the seed branched out into many different beings.  It experienced a sort of feedback cycle that woke him up to the issues associated with service-to-self and empire, so he left the situation.

He said that he went to a distant planet for centuries to shift and grow, to essentially ascend from the 4th to 5th density.  He said he's about to shift into the 6th density, but needs to address the karma he incurred working with the empire in abduction and offers his assistance in stopping and finding peace with these experiences.

&#x200B;

**Conclusions / Working Hypotheses**

Life is a journey and I'm not finished with it or ET contact.  These stories and my conclusions are just snapshots of this journey.  I will likely have a different perspective week.  Here are some condensed points that seem important to communicate now as conclusions:

* Consciousness is primary and life is dream-like
   * Life is very real, its just that there's a deeper story and mind that is coordinating events
* ET Contact invites a deeper connection or awareness of the super-conscious realms 
* Hypnotic regression is a misleading term because the memories of experience may not be experienceable in ordinary waking consciousness
* Any preconceived notion or stereotype of alien/et contact will never fit the actual experience because the experience involves more than the conceptual mind and the physical body
* It has been more effective for me to grow and develop my own consciousness than to try and remember historical or physical events
* I am immensely hopeful about our situation and about ET contact

I'd love to hear from people who have similar stories and I'd be happy to answer questions.

3. they have a _feeling_ that if they look away from the alien and then look back again, they will be less scared. sometimes, when they look back, the alien has transformed into a familiar figure, sometimes not.

119,aliens,An argument for [advanced] bipedal extraterrestrials,"First and foremost, astrobiology is a projection of terrestrial biology and it’s well recognized that life could have developed in a variety of ways. **The following argument is based on terrestrial knowledge applied to extraterrestrial development.**

I also want to clarify that I am making an argument for *highly advanced* bipedal extraterrestrials, and that like Earth, other planets likely possess a litany of life forms which have various lineages. For the context of this argument, a highly advanced species is one that uses tools and technology to communicate, per Britannica definition.

&#x200B;

* If a species is advanced, then they must have developed tools at some point.
* To develop tools they would’ve needed “hands” or some highly articulate appendage.
* As tools developed into technology, they would’ve needed increasing dexterity and articulation in “hands” for finer detailing (such as soldering, or sewing)
* To prevent damage or over use, the species likely would’ve stopped weight bearing on “hands”.
* Also if the “hands” were used to weight bear they would likely be muscular and thus less articulate.
* Even numbered limbs are ubiquitous because of the cell division process in embryos
* 4 limbs is not only most common\*\*(see edit) because of our ancestors' physical structures, but is highly advantageous because it provides stability, torso protection, and strength without extra developmental costs. (ie: 6 legs provides even more stability, but requires 50% more energy to build muscle/tissue and fuel function - life has found a great cost/benefit balance in 4 limbs)
* Chances are most species then would have 4 limbs, meaning the species that advanced to having intelligence is most likely to have 4 limbs
* “Hands” became articulate making the species bipedal.
* It is unlikely a species would develop extra limbs AFTER becoming bipedal because they are advanced to have tools and technology and can use their intelligence to solve any issues arising from their bipedal life now.

A fun little add-on, assuming the above argument is true, extraterrestrials might have offspring similar to human babies…

* As a species becomes bipedal, like humans, their hips are likely to narrow which allows a greater range of motion for walking, running, sitting, squatting….ect.
* This leads to a narrower birth canal, making it more advantageous to give birth earlier to a less developed fetus.
* Over time, fetuses that continue to survive birth become smaller and less developed which requires more care from the parents following birth!

I must confess the above 3 points on birthing changes were stolen from the book “Sapiens” by Yuval Noah Harari.

&#x200B;

Please do let me know if you have thoughts on any of these points.... and yes, I **FULLY** acknowledge that embryos, cell division, and everything else is subjective to Earth and might look entirely different in another form of life.

EDIT: 4 limbs is most common in species that are considered intelligent or advanced on Earth, vertebrates. On Earth we define these as species that have purposeful action and thought. Dogs, Monkeys, Humans, Dolphins (they have 4 limbs!), and 32 species of animals that use tools are all 4 limbed.

EDIT: Since I've been replying to several upset comments saying ""This is all Earth based!!"" despite the disclaimers...I'll ask everyone, what do you think is the first difference we should consider outside of an Earth based framework? I think gravity is near the top of the list - which could lead to different atmospheres, body development, land development ect ect....

Researchers like David M. Jacobs have published widely about the very real potential threat of hybrid aliens.

124,aliens,Found a podcast that discusses the Transcendence Hypothesis. It’s an interesting one of the Fermi Paradox theories.,"Could aliens of transcended this 3D world?

https://www.podcasttheway.com/l/transcendence-hypothesis/

Description copy and pasted below:

Where is extraterrestrial life and why haven't we seen anything, dead or alive, yet? I mean, Matt Williams tells me maybe we have already with Oumuamua Oumuamua, but that's still up for debate among researchers. Why haven't we confirmed anything outside our planet yet? Enter, the Fermi Paradox. In today's episode, we discussed the ins and outs of finding other lifeforms, along with Matt's favorite theory for this dilemma, the Transcension Hypothesis.

Bio: Hello all. What can I say about me? Well, I'm a space/astronomy journalist and a science communicator. And I also enjoy reading and writing hard science fiction. It's not just because of my day job, it's also something I've been enthused about since I was young. By the time I was seventeen, I began writing my own fiction and eventually decided it was something I wanted to pursue.

Aside from writing about things that are ground in real science, I prefer the kind of SF that tackles the most fundamental questions of existence. Like ""Who are we? Where are we going? Are we alone in the Universe?"" In any case, that's what I have always striven for: to write stories that address these questions, and the kind of books that people are similarly interested in them would want to read.

Over the years, I have written many short stories and three full-length novels, all which take place within the same fictional universe. In addition, I have written over a thousand articles for a number of publications on the subjects of science, technology, astronomy, history, cosmology, and the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI).

They have been featured in publications like Business Insider, Phys.org, Real Clear Science, Science Alert!, Futurism, and Knowridge Science Report.",szipxk,7,,1645626352.0,7,0.77

Imagine that in the Infinite Quantum Possibilities of the Proverbial Multiverse a Tree happened to fall and break itself in the right way to form a Chair, but Imagination skips all the coin flips and give us a Process to create said Chair quickly. 1: Grab Axe & take down Tree. B. Grab Saw and make logs. C. Shape Logs into Chair. 

This might sound like a rather dumbed down simplification of how Imagination and Logic managed by a Conscious Mind can beat the Natural Coin Flip of the Universe to ""cheat"" things into Existence. But it serves to kinda explain how truly ""Alien"" the Human way of behaving is to the rules of Nature. 

What we call Civilization is a Fire that can fuel any dream we could Imagine, yet it is burning indiscriminately. And the brighter a Fire Burns the Quicker it will Fade Away. 

Now that Humanity is stepping into the realm of Quantum Possibilities, which multiplies this process exponentially, will we use this Revolution in the Perception of Reality to achieve the Collective Dreams of human kind? Or the Selfish Ambitions of a Few born into Wealth and Power? 

I am indeed excited to see what Humanity comes up with next, Im fascinated by how Universe works and how humans manage to cheat said rules over and over again. But Im also afraid that its been millennia and we still dont wake up to our godly power of beating Causality, because if we used said power collectively in harmony with Nature, we would need no rescue from anyone, but as things are now Im gonna post this in Aliens in case someone can shut those nukes down.

138,aliens,"The famous “Sheldon list.” famous American writer Sidney Sheldon, working on his novel “The End of the World”, drew attention to a series of mysterious deaths among British specialists developing space weapons.","Famous American astronomer Morris K. Jessup, whose books about intelligent life beyond Earth have become bestsellers, committed suicide. He ended his life by opening an exhaust pipe in his car, locking his door and turning on the ignition.

AUTO ACCIDENT–Professor Keith Bowden, 45, computer scientist, Essex University. In March 1982 Bowden’s car plunged off a bridge, into am abandoned rail yard. His death was listed as an accident. MISSING PERSON–Lieutenant Colonel Anthony Godley, 49, defense expert, head of work-study unit at the Royal Military College of Science. Godley disappeared in April 1983. His father bequeathed him more than $60,000, with the proviso that he claim it be 1987. He never showed up and is presumed dead.

SHOTGUN BLAST–Roger Hill, 49, radar designer and draftsman, Marconi. In March 1985 Hill allegedly killed himself with a shotgun at the family home.

DEATH LEAP–Jonathan Walsh, 29, digital-communications expert assigned to British Telecom’s secret Martlesham Health research facility (and to GEC, Marconi’s parent firm). In November 1985 Walsh allegedly fell from his hotel room while working on a British Telecom project in Abidjan, Ivory Coast (Africa). He had expressed a fear for his life. Verdict: Still in question.

DEATH LEAP–Vimal Dajibhai, 24, computer-software engineer (worked on guidance system for Tigerfish torpedo), Marconi Underwater Systems. In August 1986 Dajibhai’s crumpled remains were found 240 feet below the Clifton suspension bridge in Bristol. The death has not been listed as a suicide.

DECAPITATION–Ashaad Sharif, 26, computer analyst, Marconi Defense Systems. In October 1986, in Bristol, Sharif allegedly tied one end of a rope around a tree and the other end around his neck, then drove off in his car at high-speed. Verdict: Suicide.

SUFFOCATION–Richard Pugh, computer consultant for the Ministry of Defense. In January 1987 Pugh was found dead, wrapped head-to- toe in rope that was tied four times around his neck. The coroner listed his death as an accident due to a sexual experiment gone awry.

ASPHYXIATION–John Brittan, Ministry of Defense tank batteries expert, Royal Military College of Science. In January 1987 Brittan was found dead in a parked car in his garage. The engine was still running. Verdict: Accidental death.

DRUG OVERDOSE–Victor Moore, 46, design engineer, Marconi Space Systems. In February 1987 Moore was found dead of a drug overdose. His death is listed as a suicide.

ASPHYXIATION–Peter Peapell, 46, scientist, Royal Military College of Science. In February 1987 Peapell was found dead beneath his car, his face near the tail pipe, in the garage of his Oxfordshire home. Death was due to carbon-monoxide poisoning, although test showed that the engine had been running only a short time. Foul play has not been ruled out.

ASPHYXIATION–Edwin Skeels, 43, engineer, Marconi. In February 1987 Skeels was found dead in his car, a victim of carbon-monoxide poisoning. A hose led from the exhaust pipe. His death is listed as a suicide.

AUTO ACCIDENT–David Sands, satellite projects manager, Eassams (a Marconi sister company). Although up for a promotion, in March 1987 Sands drove a car filled with gasoline cans into the brick wall of an abandoned cafe. He was killed instantly. Foul play has not been ruled out.

AUTO ACCIDENT–Stuart Gooding, 23, postgraduate research student, Royal Military College of Science. In April 1987 Gooding died in a mysterious car wreck in Cyprus while the College was holding military exercises on the island. Verdict: Accidental death.

AUTO ACCIDENT–George Kountis, experienced systems analyst at British Polytechnic. In April 1987 Kountis drowned after his BMW plunged into the Mersey River in Liverpool. His death is listed as a misadventure.

SUFFOCATION–Mark Wisner, 24, software engineer at Ministry of Defense experimental station for combat aircraft. In April 1987 Wisner was found dead in his home with a plastic bag over his head. At the inqust, his death was ruled an accident due to a sexual experiment gone awry.

AUTO ACCIDENT–Michael Baker, 22, digital-communications expert, Plessey Defense Systems. In May 1987 Baker’s BMW crashed through a road barrier, killing the driver. Verdict: Misadventure.

HEART ATTACK–Frank Jennings, 60, electronic-weapons engineer for Plessey. In June 1987 Jennings allegedly dropped dead of a heart attack. No inquest was held.

DEATH LEAP–Russel Smith, 23, lab technician at the Atomic Energy Research Establishment. In January 1988 Smith’s mangled body was found halfway down a cliff in Cornwall. Verdict: Suicide.

ASPHYXIATION–Trevor Knight, 52, computer engineer, Marconi Space and Defense Systems. In March 1988 Knight was found dead in his car, asphyxiated by fume from a hose attached to the tail pipe. The death was ruled a suicide.

ELECTROCUTION–John Ferry, 60, assistant marketing director for Marconi. In August 1988 Ferry was found dead in a company-owned apartment, the stripped leads of an electrical cord in his mouth. Foul play has not been ruled out.

ELECTROCUTION–Alistair Beckham, 50, software engineer, Plessey. In August 1988 Beckham’s lifeless body was found in the garden shed behind his house. Bare wires, which ran to a live main, were wrapped around his chest. Now suicide note was found, and police habe not ruled out foul play.

ASPHYXIATION–Andrew Hall, 33, engineering manager, British Aero- space. In September 1988 Hall was found dead in his car, asphyxiated by fumes from a hose that was attached to the tail pipe. Friends said he was well liked, had everything to live for. Verdict: Suicide.

In October of 1986, Professor Arshad Sharif killed himself by tying one end of the rope to a tree, making a loop at the other end, putting his head through it and driving the car away. A few days later another London professor, Vimal Dazibay, jumped head first from the Bristol Bridge. Both of them worked on the development of electronic weapons for the English government program, similar to the American “Star Wars.”

In January of 1987, another scientist, Avtar Singh-Guide, went missing. He was later declared dead. In February of 1987, Peter Pippel was run over by his car in his garage. In March of 1987, David Sands committed suicide by crashing his car into a building. In April of 1987, four developers of space programs died. Mark Wiesner hung himself, Stuart Gooding fell victim of murder, David Greenhalgh fell off the bridge, and Shani Warren drowned. In May of that year, Michael Baker was killed in a car accident.

In a relatively short time, 25 people who worked in the space field died for various reasons. Sidney Sheldon, who discovered this tragic phenomenon, seriously believed that it had to do with aliens.

According to Timothy Hood, these deaths were not accidental, but rather, were the work of special services that eliminated the experts because they knew too much.

In the 1970’s and 1980’s in the United States there were secret UFO research programs such as the “Blue Book”, “Aquarius”, “Area 51”, “Majestic 12”, and GEIPAN. While official data show that most of these projects are now inactive, many conspiracy theorists doubt it. Every now and then “sensational” materials emerge in the media whose purpose is to convince the public that the U.S. government is hiding the truth about human contact with aliens.

Perhaps it has to do not with the aliens but military secrets or falsified facts. In any case, the intrigue remains. The topic of contacts with other civilizations continues to thrill, and the perceived danger makes it even more exciting.

145,aliens,"This 1954 event in Altus, Oklahoma illustrates a common behavior of UFOs: they often leave an area at a high rate of speed, only to reappear in front of the witnesses again, before making its final exit.","#A School in Altus, Oklahoma

“It was clear as a bell that morning and not a cloud of anything in the sky.” This fact would later become important, says “Keith.”


It was 7:40 a.m., on October 15, 1954, and Keith was on his way to school in Altus, Oklahoma. “I was just a child going to school on his bicycle,” he wrote in his report to MUFON. 


He had just reached the intersection before the school when it happened: “I saw the saucer come in very fast and come to an abrupt hover about 400 to 500 feet above the ground,” Keith says. “The traffic cop who was directing traffic at the intersection that morning saw cars stop next to me, and the people got out and were staring up at the saucer, as was I. And the officer turned and watched too. Everyone around was looking up at it as it hovered. 


*Then panels of windows appeared around the center of the disc, and human-form persons were looking out.*


 “This lasted about twenty to thirty seconds,” Keith says, “and then the panels became opaque again. And then the saucer moved westward at an astonishing speed, without a sound, and did a ninety-degree turn south and went out of sight in that direction.” 


While the sighting was dramatic enough, it wasn’t over yet. 


“A few seconds later,” says Keith, “it returned to the *same spot it had left*, and came to a hover again. It hovered there only about fifteen seconds before it moved west at a high rate of speed, and suddenly went straight up and disappeared at an astonishing rate of speed. 


""Then an F-86 jet fighter was scrambled from the nearby air force base and went westward as if to look for the object.” 


The sighting caused a local sensation, and later, says Keith, meteorologists tried to debunk the sighting, calling it “a reflection of light” from a plane shining on the base of a cloud of moisture. Keith discounts the explanation, as he remembers that the day was cloudless. “Nothing was ever mentioned about it again,” Keith says.

147,aliens,Putting some Coherence to the Breadcrumbs of this Soft-Slow Disclosure,"  

1. In [quantum field theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_field_theory), the **quantum vacuum state** (also called the **quantum vacuum** or **vacuum state**) is the [quantum state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_state) with the lowest possible [energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy). Generally, it contains no physical particles. The word **zero-point field** is sometimes used as a synonym for the vacuum state of a quantized field which is completely individual.

According to present-day understanding of what is called the vacuum state or the quantum vacuum, it is ""by no means a simple empty space"".[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_vacuum_state#cite_note-Lambrecht-1)[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_vacuum_state#cite_note-Ray-2) According to quantum mechanics, the vacuum state is not truly empty but instead contains fleeting [electromagnetic waves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_waves) and [particles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle) that pop into and out of the quantum field.[\[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_vacuum_state#cite_note-3)[\[4\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_vacuum_state#cite_note-4)[\[5\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_vacuum_state#cite_note-Dittrich-5)

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum\_vacuum\_state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_vacuum_state) 

2. From this field Harold Puthoff argues that we one day can get Zero Point Energy to travel throw space using a energy similar to the Casimir Effect. 

([https://www.researchgate.net/publication/13385874\_Source\_of\_vacuum\_electromagnetic\_zero-point\_energy](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/13385874_Source_of_vacuum_electromagnetic_zero-point_energy) )

3. It is widely accepted that consciousness or, more generally, mental activity is in some way correlated to the behavior of the material brain. Since quantum theory is the most fundamental theory of matter that is currently available, it is a legitimate question to ask whether quantum theory can help us to understand consciousness. Several approaches answering this question affirmatively, proposed in recent decades, will be surveyed. There are three basic types of corresponding approaches: (1) consciousness is a manifestation of quantum processes in the brain, (2) quantum concepts are used to understand consciousness without referring to brain activity, and (3) matter and consciousness are regarded as dual aspects of one underlying reality.

[https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qt-consciousness/](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qt-consciousness/) 

4. One interesting speculative theory in my opinion is the following :’’ This consciousness merge with supreme consciousness which is zero point energy. It has been experimentally proven that zero point energy exists even at absolute zero temperature. The author postulates that this zero point energy not only exists in our universe but also outside the universe and was there even before Big Bang which created our universe.’’

[https://www.neuroquantology.com/article.php?id=1433](https://www.neuroquantology.com/article.php?id=1433)

5. Taking into account that consciousness and life in general is found in all parts of the universe therefore this conclusion of Tom Delong in his book Sekret Machines follows: ‘’ *""The universe is teeming with life. There are intelligences at all different levels on a lot of different planets. There's humans everywhere; super-humans with telepathic powers even. Some of them are like us. Some of them are cavemen. There's also inorganic beings on rock planets; oxygen is toxic to them.* ***There's weird bands of light that swim in space like whales.*** *There's amoebas that are going around sucking energy -- some of them could be as big as Jupiter, or as big as a Volkswagen, it varies.""*

6. Lue Elizondo :‘’But the universe is huge,the universe is grandiose and um….we like to look at mankind and we say ""mankind is having 2 arms, 2 legs, 10 fingers and what not""and that kind of defines who we are as a human being and a species but maybe there's a larger family. Maybe there's something bigger to it.maybe we have a lot more in common in fact life in the universe has more in common with itself..."" …""Maybe Mankind is Mankind(s) plural and we are part of a larger family.""

So im speculating here that Lue in fact is insinuating that there are conscious beings that don’t look like us but are the most similar things to us. In the sense that they are conscious like us and have a ‘’soul’’. Therefore ‘’life in the universe has more in common with itself’’ and there are ‘’mankinds’’ or different forms of intelligent conscious life.

7. One of the beings we are seeing in the Sky is The Intelligent Plasma. Dr Massimo Teodorani theorized that what we are seeing as the Ufo Phenomenon are conscious Plasma Beings moving throw the skies 

(Dr Massimo Teodorani is part of the Galileo Project and has done very serious studies on the Plasma Phenomenon in Hessdalen, a well known case in Ufo, in wich he studies.

8. Aliens were involved with the creation of humanity. Insinuated in different occasions in interviews from Lue Elizondo that we can find proofs in our DNA, insinuated in The Sekret Machines from Tom Delonge. John Ramirez , Ex Cia agent speculated as well that we are Hybrids.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracyNOPOL/comments/l5mbzi/to\_the\_stars\_academy\_tom\_dlonge\_and\_the\_beliefs/](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracyNOPOL/comments/l5mbzi/to_the_stars_academy_tom_dlonge_and_the_beliefs/) 

9. Because we are created from this beings. ‘’Humans do have the capacity for advanced mental abilities such as telekinesis, telepathy, remote viewing, precognition. This is being studied at facilities like Groom Lake alongside advanced craft development.’’ ( Insinuated by Tom Delonge in Sekret Machines and proven that this is possible in statistical terms by Harold Puthoff ) [https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracyNOPOL/comments/l5mbzi/to\_the\_stars\_academy\_tom\_dlonge\_and\_the\_beliefs/](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracyNOPOL/comments/l5mbzi/to_the_stars_academy_tom_dlonge_and_the_beliefs/) 

10. Ufo are not  ‘’ Nuts and bolts’’ as Elizondo said he wants to destroy Ufology.

In Dimensions Jaques Valles basically destroyes this hypothese with very convincing arguments. Than what about the metamaterials and Rosewell ?To that Gary Nolan has answered that most probably is a  form of instantaneous 3d printing from  beings that have a technology much advanced than us that  seems like magic to us. 

11. The somber part of the Disclosure is that some of these  entities have created us, manipulated us,and actually psychologically and culturally control us.Most of the Religions were created by these Being to control us.  ‘’We are Property’’ as Jaques Vallees puts it.We are not the top of the chain of the predators as Lue Elizondo has said. 

Lue Elizondo refered to the Chain of Sea as good reference to understand these beings being here with us all the time and more powerfull than us. Taken from the book: ‘’One day a bizarre menagerie of aliens land on earth, but ignore humanity. They're in contact with a bunch of ultraterrestrials who live on earth in a complementary reality that only a few humans can see. Together, the aliens, the ultraterrestrials, and humanity's own AI constructs decide to wipe humanity off the face of the planet. The main character--a school age boy--is one of the only humans that can perceive these ultraterrestrials. As such, they warn him that at any moment humanity will be destroyed. So he's prescribed sedatives. ‘’.

 “Human beings are under the control of a strange force that bends them in absurd ways, forcing them to play a role in a bizarre game of deception.” Jacques Vallee

12. Interesting aspect of these reality seems to be that there are more than one species interacting with humans. There are also a benevolent species who have ‘’drip-fed us knowledge and technology throughout human history.’’Who are in conflict with the other species. 

These can be concluded throw various religious text and doctrines like the Gnostics Text, Book of Enoch, and the Vedic Text. Mentioning different Gods fighting against each other.

In 2001, retired US Air Force Sergeant Karl Wolfe came forward claiming that in during the mid 1960s whilst in an NSA facility he was shown a collage of photographs taken by the lunar orbiter showing alien structures on the moon. 

In his words:  *""He pulled out one of these mosaics, and showed this base which had geometric shapes - there were towers, there were spherical buildings, there were very tall towers and things that looked somewhat like radar dishes, but they were very large structures,""* 

He was killed in 2018 at the age of 74 in a cycling accident, it was said that a tractor drove into the back of him. 

What are peoples opinions on his claims? Personally, I think he comes across in the interview as very credible but I could be wrong.

Novel: \[smiles\] *He’s reputedly ah,* ***MJ-4***, *but whether he is or not I don’t know. He’s a nice guy. He and I are friendly, so I’m not going to say anything negative about Bob. I don’t know anything negative.*

[https://projectcamelot.org/lang/en/gordon\_novel\_interview\_transcript\_en.html](https://projectcamelot.org/lang/en/gordon_novel_interview_transcript_en.html) (3/4 down the webpage)

After a bit more excavation of the rabbit hole, I found the following:

1. Inman was nominated by then-**President Bill Clinton** to be Defense Secretary in **December 1993**. He was considered to be a very sharp Intelligence Community insider, having been the **Director of Naval Intelligence,** **Director of NSA,** and **Deputy Director CIA** (at one stage, when transitioning from DIRNSA to DDCI, he held both positions simultaneously, and according to NSA folklore wrote memos to himself to get favorable policies pushed through regarding budgets). He was a veteran of the war between NSA and CIA, preventing a proposal from **DCI Stansfield Turner** for CIA to absorb the NSA functions during the Carter / Regan administrations, and was due to attend his **Confirmation Hearing in late January 1994.**
2. On the **12th January 1994,** a group called the **Computer UFO Network (CUFON)** decided to write the following memo and send it to the mainstream media and selected members of the **Senate Armed Services Committee,** in order to ask certain questions to Inman during his confirmation hearing:

*Has Secretary of Defense designate* ***Admiral Bobby Ray Inman, Ret.,*** *made*

*statements* ***indicating that the U.S. Government has extraterrestrial craft in***

***its possession?*** *Admiral Inman has been credited with making such statements*

*which have been construed as meaning that he was aware:*

*\** *that* ***""recovered vehicles""*** *(meaning* ***extraterrestrial alien craft***\*) have been in possession of the government for over 10 years,\*

*\** *he had ""****some expertise****"" in the area of* ***UFO*** *before his retirement,*

*\** *that he has been aware of a program to ""****indoctrinate the public****"" in UFO*

*matters,*

*\** *that he ""****understood who is behind the technology in the crafts****"" meaning*

***extraterrestrial alien beings***\*,\*

*\** *that the matter (of U.S. government recovery and possession of alien UFO craft) was covered by the ""****national security laws****"".*

The distribution list was as follows:

Senator **John McCain**           Senator **John Glenn**            Senator Jeff Bingaman

Senator **Edward Kennedy**   Senator D. Kempthorne     Senator Carl Levin

CNN         Larry King Live        The Washington Post        Reuters America

AP             UPI        Adm. Inman

[www.cufon.org/cufon/inmanpr.htm](http://www.cufon.org/cufon/inmanpr.htm)

3. On the **18th January 1994**, Inman held a press conference and announced he would not be seeking nomination as Secretary of Defense. Was Inman’s decision a direct result of not wanting to lie under oath about the subject when asked (particularly by **Senator** **Kennedy, who knew better than most of the power of the MAJESTIC GROUP and his nemesis at the New York Times, Bill Safire**) and to suppress the existence of the alien presence to the general public?

[https://www.c-span.org/video/?53874-1/inman-withdrawal-defense-secretary](https://www.c-span.org/video/?53874-1/inman-withdrawal-defense-secretary)

4. Some interesting comments from Inman at the following timestamps:

· 23:00 – Inman discovered in 1981 that Israel had direct access to the imagery produced by the NRO’s **Talent Keyhole compartment** (they didn’t have to ask for imagery). He was curious as to how the IDF had used IMINT for the attack on the **Osirak nuclear reactor** in Iraq in 1981. Inman changed this arrangement, most likely over simmering feelings still felt over the ***USS Liberty*** incident, in which NSA civilian SIGINT operators were killed. I found this strange because prior to the creation of the NRO, the CIA was responsible for the KEYHOLE satellites. The person responsible for the **“Israeli desk” at CIA** for 20 years was none other than **James Jesus Angleton**, the only CIA officer who has their own memorial garden in Jeruselum. [In Honor of James Angleton, Founding Father of the CIA-Mossad Alliance (deepstateblog.org)](https://www.deepstateblog.org/2019/03/09/in-honor-of-james-angelton-founding-father-of-the-cia-mossad-alliance/)

· 29:00- Senator **John McCain** is mentioned (one of the CUFON memo recipients)

· 31:00 - The **Clinton’s** involvement in the **Whitewater Affair** is mentioned

· 32:15 – “**There are certain clubs I won’t resign from**” (specifically the **Bohemian Club / Grove**, but I wonder if this is a veiled speech reference to **MAJESTIC TWELVE**)?

· 39:50 – “I scare the bejesus out of people because **I am a product of the Military-Industrial Complex**”

5. The Clinton connection is interesting too – did they “**cotton-on**” to MAJESTIC TWELVE through Inman’s declination of the DEFSEC position, and become interested in this subject matter as a **way to make money (by selling classified info)** after they left the Whitehouse? [Hillary Clinton: We Were 'Dead Broke' Upon Leaving White House | HuffPost Latest News](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/clintons-broke-white-house_n_5474015) and [Hillary Clinton Emails Held Info Beyond Top Secret: IG (nbcnews.com)](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/hillary-clinton-emails-contained-info-above-top-secret-ig-n499886)

6. **Gordon Novel** was the predecessor to **Tom DeLonge** regarding Disclosure. He was trying to shop a movie around Hollywood called **The Supreme Cosmic Secret.** In this interview with New Realities’ **Alan Steinfeld**, he name drops **John Podesta** as someone he has been talking to in this regard (30:11 timestamp): [https://youtu.be/eFa\_lTkESD0](https://youtu.be/eFa_lTkESD0)

7. Inman was also on the board of **Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC),** which Ex-NASA mission specialist **Bob Oechsler**, believed was involved in UFO research alongside other major aerospace contractors. Oechsler was the **original source of the CUFON statements**, which he obtained from Inman via a phone interview in 1989: [Ex-NASA man who claimed space agency was covering up ET visitations, 'alien corpse in a cryogenic tank' and UFOs dies (thesun.co.uk)](https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/11890347/ex-nasa-man-dies-of-cancer/)

8. I found this reference to “M/J Operations” on the CIA Reading Room site:

&#x200B;

[Corona KH4 satellites](https://preview.redd.it/siaexf6yzyi81.png?width=1392&format=png&auto=webp&s=3112dc848c3922fd9443e6d76302ededa1418aef)

Initially, I thought these birds were tasked with trying to capture UAPs / UFOs interacting with atomic radiation clouds, as there were 4 nuclear tests at the **Tonopah Range** around the date of the memo which studied nuclear fallout propagation. However, as much as I would like M/J to reference MAJESTIC/JEHOVAH, I believe it is in reference to the model of the **CORONA KH-4 “M”** / **KH-4 “J”** satellites that were used at the time. [CORONA (satellite) - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CORONA_(satellite))

The tests of nuclear radiation around the time the memo was written may have been what they (and other partner nations) were interested in. At the time, the Keyhole satellites did 80-90 orbits (around 3 days) and then the film was ejected, re-entered the Earth’s atmosphere, and was caught by an airplane as it descended by parachute. The still-redacted portions of the mission profile and memo may be a reference to the CIA setting up their **film and computer systems to share the data directly with Israel,** obviously under the **ever-watchful eye of the Owl – James Jesus Angleton.** His dual role as Chief of Counter-Intelligence and custodian of the Israel desk at the CIA has always puzzled me. [Secret JFK document #2: James Angleton's testimony > JFK Facts](http://jfkfacts.org/secret-jfk-document-2-james-angletons-testimony/)

As an aside, I have always considered the creation of Israel in 1948 as having been directly related to the crash retrievals of 1947 and the discovery of the Dead Sea scrolls the same year. The source of this information was passed to me (and anyone else at the time who was interested) in a very peculiar way. When I started my working career in 1989, I traveled into the Central Business District of Sydney, Australia every weekday. Occasionally, I would come across a homeless-looking guy with a scruffy beard and long hair that had two paper flour sacks tied together over his shoulders, like a walking billboard sign. On these sacks he would draw in very elaborate, cursive writing “**UFOs are Gods**”, “**Ezekiel 1:16** **was describing a UFO**”, and “**2018 – 70 years after Roswell the Lord will return**”. I would see him at various places – standing on the side of the busy Bradfield Hwy leading to the Sydney Harbour Bridge, Central Railway Station, and other random places. He would just stand there, not talking. I even approached him once to ask him about it, and he just stared *through* me, not uttering a word. The last time I saw an example of his work in 1991 was probably the weirdest though – he had nailed it onto a telegraph pole in the backstreet of a small town 60 kms from Sydney. I found this strange as it was out the back of a small church where I had just attended a wedding – definitely not for the mainstream view. I would be interested to know if anyone else had ever seen or heard of this strangely prophetic fellow.

Gordon Novel’s interview with Jack Sarfatti has some notable timestamps, though not related to Inman or UFOs specifically:

[https://youtu.be/01VI3EDfVO8](https://youtu.be/01VI3EDfVO8)

· 15:26 – claims **J. Edgar Hoover** was **compromised** by films/photos “with kids” (al la Epstein Island?)

· 20:00 – mentions “the Dragstrip”. How did Novel find the CIA? He didn’t, they found him. Novel bought a disused dragstrip in 1960 with grand plans for it. Also located on the land were secure bunkers for storing explosives used by O&G company Schlumberger. CIA needed access to the bunker for the Bay of Pigs operation, so they approached Novel for the key, and thus started the relationship.

· 21:00 – “yeah I was involved with **Angleton, Colby,** and **Conein** – don’t forget the name **Lucian Conein**”. One of the original OSS members along with Hunt, Helms, and Colby, and had connections with the Corsican Brotherhood during WW2. Novel says to “remember” his name, because Conein was most likely directly involved in the recruitment of **Corsican hitman Lucian Sarti** for “**the Big Event**” (JFK assassination).

[Lucien Conein (spartacus-educational.com)](https://spartacus-educational.com/JFKconein.htm)

· 21:47 – Indictment by Garrison. It is hard to watch Gordon Novel’s interviews, mainly because he **talks in riddles**. I believe this is primarily because he sued Jim Garrison, who claimed Novel worked for the CIA. Having won the lawsuit, he was probably reluctant to admit that he actually did work for them, in case he perjured himself. Novel and William Colby both made enemies in the FBI when they worked on the Waco inquiry and did not want to kick the hornet’s nest again.

This hole is deep, though Admiral Inman is still alive and he may now be more open to discussing ""**Disclosure**"".  If we continue to ask people who are nearing the end of their life like Inman and Kissinger what they know, we may get a Nat Kobitz response - i.e. ""**F\_ck it, what are they going to do to me?""**

Another rare and unusual early humanoid case comes from Evelyn Wendt whose encounter occurred in 1924 while playing on the schoolyard of St. Joseph Elementary School in Dade City, Florida. 


“The first thing I remember,” says Wendt, “is that this egg-shaped thing was on the ground and this bright light was shining in my eyes. Then the light went out, a hatch opened and little people emerged. I think they were robots; they were smaller than I, and resembled animated flowers with faces where the bud would be. Remember, I was just a bitty thing then, and kids don’t fear flowers.” 


The figures were carrying what Evelyn believed was a weapon of some sort to the school’s science building. 


“I wanted to help them, but someone said, ‘Stop.’ I replied that they were so small, I was going to assist. The creatures let me try, but I couldn’t even budge the machine.


""I was told they were going to stop the work that was being done in the science building. They said if the work continued, they would destroy the place. Later I heard the place was in shambles. There seemed to me to be a man with the little people. 


""The conversation wasn’t real talking. 


""When they were going to leave, they asked if I wanted to go, but I said no. they promised to come back for me in thirty-five years, but nothing happened. 


""The saucer appeared to be made from very pock-marked lead, but then when it started up, its molecules maybe expanded because it turned silver bright. It went straight up, hovered and then disappeared.” 


Unfortunately, there is no further information on this strange case, particularly regarding other witnesses.

160,aliens,10 UFO Investigators Who Died Mysteriously Under Suspicious Circumstances?,"10. Ron Rummel

**Ron Rummel** worked as an Air Force intelligence agent. In the years leading up to his death, he was the publisher of the UFO journal Alien Digest. Some of the topics discussed in this magazine revolved around the idea that aliens have indeed been present on Earth for a long time. 

9. Ron Johnson

**Ron Johnson** was one of the ufologists who worked for the MUFON organization, the main UFO community in the United States. In June 1994, he was at a MUFON meeting in Texas when he suddenly collapsed to the floor, dead. 

8. John Murphy

**John Murphy** was not a direct UFO researcher, but a radio journalist who just happened to be in Kecksburg at the right time in December 1965, when the famous incident occurred with a likely UFO crash in these places.

7. Tony Dodd

In the 1990s and early 2000s, **Tony Dodd** was one of the leading British ufologists. The fact that he had a long career as a police detective under his belt only made him much more reliable regarding the incidents he investigated.

6. John Mac

**John Mack** was killed by a drunk driver in London in 2004 and his death is still considered highly suspicious.

Mack was a Harvard University professor who once became fascinated with UFOs and began to study cases of alien abductions. In the UK, many consider him one of the first “academicians”. serious about ufology.

5. Ann Livingston

UFO researcher and MUFON member **Ann Livingston** died in 1994 from a fast-acting and very aggressive form of ovarian cancer. However, many of her MUFON colleagues and close friends began to wonder if her multiple UFO sightings and subsequent encounters with the Men in Black could have been related to her tragic death.

4. Jim Keith

The death of explorer and writer **Jim Keith** could very well be the result of a series of coincidences, but they seemed rather strange. 

Keith’s first activity was to study the work of Danny Casolaro (an investigative journalist whose death was also suspicious). In his book, The Octopus claimed that Casolaro’s claims about the existence of the Octopus group were real. This shadow group allegedly controls many world events. 

3. James Forrestal

Next, on our list of UFO investigators who died mysteriously is **James Forrestal**.

On the night of May 22, 1949, James Forrestal, the very first United States Secretary of Defense to retire a few months before that date, jumped off the 13th floor of the Bethesda Naval Hospital in Maryland. 

2. Morris K. Jessup

Next, on our list of UFO investigators who died mysteriously is **Morris K. Jessup**.

One of the first American UFO researchers was Morris K. Jessup, author of the 1955 book The Case for UFOs. Little did Jessup know that the release of this book would set off a series of events that would lead to his tragic death.

1. Phil Schneider

The final and most controversial person on our list of UFO investigators who died mysteriously is Phil Schneider.

In the early 1990s, **Phil Schneider** began a series of public lectures in which he claimed to have worked for the US government at various underground facilities. And it was during this work that he witnessed a real battle between underground aliens and employees of a military underground base near Dulce in New Mexico. ",swdeb5,154,,1645286913.0,33,0.93

162,aliens,Reality check: alien life would be waaaay way different,"We will probably never discover (intelligent) alien life because we’d most likely just end up looking right past it without even noticing it.

What we define as advanced life is based on our human standards of “advancement.” There could be alien life more “intelligent/advanced” than us, but with no desire to explore the cosmos, create civilizations, or even contact us.

And maybe alien life would be so different than terrestrial life that we wouldn’t even recognize each other if we did come face to face. A super-intelligent alien might just appear to us as an amorphous blob or a cloud of dust. Likewise, a human civilization might just appear to an ET as a layer of dirty mold growing on an otherwise green planet. 

We send radio waves out into space hoping for intelligent life to communicate back with us, but why would it? What if the signals we beam out as we try to communicate with aliens are just picked up on their end as “pretty background noise” the same way that birds calling to each other just sounds like pretty and meaningless noises to us. 

What if an entire solar system is a super-intelligent being that communicates with other ones. We might only think our solar system is lifeless because we are each just a microscopic piece of the entire being, just like the cells that make up your body aren’t aware of the entirety of you, because they’re each just a small piece of your organism. 

There could be a sentient being that isn’t even a living thing. If we wish to communicate with other sentience, we might need to think way outside the box and drastically reevaluate what really constitutes as “life, intelligence, advanced, etc.”",sw6hn3,13,,1645264241.0,67,0.64

164,aliens,"This is another so-called ""Airship"" encounter on July 24, 1909 (the same year we discussed with the men in fur coats in Wales) but this event occurred in New Zealand. That would be quite a long flight for a fledgling airship in that year:","#The Kelso School Sighting 

This is one of the earliest schoolyard reports that involves a humanoid. On July 24, 1909, several children were outside their school in Kelso, New Zealand when a strange boat-shaped machine appeared in the sky. Most amazing, the students could see the figure of a person seated inside it.


 The craft was first seen approaching from the Blue Mountains. It then traveled over the school and began to circle high above it. Student Thomas Jenkins said the object appeared around noon, dipped below the level of the mountains and would occasionally stop and hover. Student Thomas McDonald thought it was a bird at first, but as it turned, he distinctly saw a whirling propeller at the rear end. Alice Falconer said that the object moved extremely quickly. She only observed it for a few moments before it was out of sight. She immediately informed her fellow students and her teachers. Alice’s brother, Cyril, also saw the object. He described how it turned sharply, at which point, he was able to see what appeared to be a propeller. 


The students weren’t alone in witnessing the object. Also at the school was Mrs. James Russell. She reported that It first appeared as a streak of blackness shooting over the hill and coming straight toward her. It was about 1500 feet away from her when it suddenly turned, swerved over some trees and went out of sight. The experience frightened her very badly. She says she was so scared, that she was unable to carefully observe the object. 


One resident interviewed some of the children and reported the encounter to authorities. He told newspaper reporters, “There is not the slightest doubt that the airship was seen at Kelso yesterday at noon. I have eyewitnesses to prove this. It is cigar or ‘boat’ shaped and pointed at each end. Those who saw it have no idea of the probable height of it above them. It did not appear to be very long in build, but was very broad. The children who saw it say that it had a pontoon-shaped part above the boat, and a short pole or mast in the center. It flew over and past the schoolground, turned around, and went back the way it came. It was flying along very easily, and had no trouble turning…It was seen by at least five persons, and their statements are all in accord.” 


The children were separated and interviewed independently. Each of the accounts corroborated each other. They also drew what they saw. “The drawings were done separately, and with no reference whatever from one another. The result was six drawings, the degree of resemblance and unanimity was nothing short of dumbfounding to all skeptics.” 


The Kelso sighting reports were published in the July 26, 1909 issue of the *Daily Times.* In his article, ‘The 1909 Kelso Airships,’ researcher Bruce Dickeson writes that starting in July 1909, a wave of UFO sightings swept over New Zealand, and that the Kelso School sighting marked the beginning of the wave. Following the July 24 sighting, numerous people throughout Kelso also reported the same object. None of the witnesses reported any noise coming from the object. 


This was one of the last widely-viewed sightings of the now-famous airship wave, which occurred primarily during the 1890s and 1900s. Most of these involved sightings of zeppelin-like objects. Many of the humanoid cases have high levels of strangeness to them that are difficult to decipher.

In 1965, a man named Arthur Bryant from a tiny village called Scoriton in England claimed that he had come into contact with three extraterrestrial entities from Venus. 

He was interviewed by investigators from BUFORA, who although initially sceptical appeared to believe him, however, some of his claims were so likened to that of George Adamski (who had died the day before the claims) many instantly believed it to be an elaborate hoax or just simply a lie. 

The article above I thought was quite a good in-depth, yet objective look at it.

173,aliens,This 1997 Moss Landing Power Plant UFO event on California's coast includes an absurd cartoon-like-grabber-arm:,"In mid-August, 1997, Joy Williams (45), her husband Tom Williams, and their friend ""Emily,"" had dinner at their home overlooking Monterey Bay in Aptos, California. From her balcony, Joy noticed a bright yellow-green glow in the water, maybe a quarter mile off-shore, well inside the northern edge of the bay. For the next few minutes, the glow slowly brightened until a gigantic egg-shaped object rose from the water. 


“It was huge,” Joy said. “It was really big…And as it was coming out, I could see all the kelp slipping off it. It rose out slowly.” 


Joy called for Tom and Emily and all three watched the object in shock through a telescope they had on the deck. The object moved slowly north, skirting the shore.


Joy later told MUFON investigators, “When we looked at it through the spyglass, we could see portholes all around the center of it.” There were about a dozen visible portholes, all elliptically shaped, alternating green and amber in color. The object was still moving slowly north and was a gold amber color.


After an estimated ten minutes, the object stopped, right next to the smokestacks of the nearby coal fire plant at Moss Landing. The object's light illuminated the smokestacks themselves, which were 500 feet in height. The object hovered immediately next to the tops.


Using the smokestacks as a reference, the trio estimated the object had to be at least fifty feet across.



Tom seemed to take the experience in stride. Joy felt slightly nervous, and wondered if the occupants of the object realized that they were being observed. Emily was the most upset of the three. “It was a little scary to be honest,” Joy says. “It disturbed me. It’s a hard emotion to express. It made me feel like I wasn’t in control, a bit intimidated because I almost felt like it knew I was watching it.” 


What happened next left them all stunned: A gigantic metallic arm emerged from the side of the craft farthest from the smoke stacks. The arm grew out of the object, extended upward and over the top of the craft, and then continued downward on the other side. The end of the arm contained a gigantic pair of pincers, which began to probe inside the opening of the smokestacks. 


“I don’t know what it was doing,” Joy says, “but it had these long pincers on it, and it looked like it was collecting something. It was just hovering right next to the power plant, *and it did that for about twenty minutes*…We couldn’t stop looking at it because it was so bizarre. We were so stunned. Like, what is this thing?” They remained in a trance-like state while the object hovered, feeling no urgency to get a camera. They commented about how the area was fairly well populated. ""Other people would surely be seeing this. The craft was huge and very bright. We couldn’t be the only witnesses.""


Fully extended, the ""arm"" was more than twice the length of the craft. The pincers alone were estimated to be at least twenty feet long.


 “My first memory of seeing this thing hovering in the sky was between us and the power plant,” Tom says. “I didn’t see it come out of the water. It had an arm on it, and several lights. There was a telescope [and] once we had a good look at it, we saw this definite arm and a couple of different colored lights. The thing itself was a kind of golden yellow color, and it hovered in the sky for quite some time."" 


After they watched the object for close to 20 minutes, Tom eventually came to his senses and called the police. The officer listened to both Joy and Tom as they explained what they were seeing. When he realized they were describing an apparent UFO, the officer’s attitude immediately changed. Like a switch being turned off, the officer dismissed their testimonies completely. “It’s probably just a fishing boat,” he told them. “In the middle of the sky?” Tom asked, incredulous. “Fishing boats don’t fly!” Joy pointed out. “This definitely came up out of the water.” 

They told the officer that the object was still there. The officer refused to listen. “It didn’t seem to make any difference to them,” Joy says. They hung up the phone and resumed their UFO vigil. After approximately five minutes, all three watched the object instantly wink out. In a split-second, it was gone.


Joy eventually contacted UFO researcher Linda Moulton Howe and shared the sighting with her. Twenty years later, in 2018, she reported the case to MUFON.

I don't know if I will be able to explain very clearly, or if maybe this is stupid and everyone else has already thought of this 400 times. I will try my best to explain what I am thinking.... I know that people have different ideas about whether or not aliens and the contact/abduction experiences that people have with them take place in the physical world, or if they actual take place on some sort of mental plane of existence, some realm where just consciousness interacts, or another dimension or reality altogether. 

Sooo..... What if, there are two real evolutionary paths for the creation of an intelligent species, or maybe the next step of evolution, from where we are now as an 'intelligent' species, to a more enlightened species... Imagine most species in the universe that have successfully made this journey have evolved via the path of expanding consciousness. Becoming one with nature, understanding their true nature, reaching enlightenment, whatever, and the next step of their evolution lead them to this new plane of reality, in which all these different spoecies coexist in a somewhat harmonious state. The reason that they have taken such an interest in humans, could be that humanity took the other, less likely evolutionary path- physical/technological evolution, where we have not grown out of our violence and other childish traits as a species, but have continued to survive through our enormous ego and legendary stubborn-ness. Maybe this is rare, and this explains why there are all these different species of beings that are all together, looking at humanity who is all alone. Like this is one of the 'great filters' and there is one commonly traveled path of success, and then the route that humans are trying to take (although we are failing). 

Does that even make sense? I don't know if I explained myself very well. I just have been thinking about this a lot lately and I am trying to work out the kinks in explaining it more clearly as the concept will play a role in the novel that I am working on.

Quote: 

 “China was fulfilling the international obligation stipulated by Article V of the Outer Space Treaty by informing the U.N. of the Starlink satellites’ dangerous approach to the Chinese space station that threatened the safety of in-orbit Chinese astronauts,” [he said according to a government transcript](https://www.fmprc.gov.cn/mfa_eng/xwfw_665399/s2510_665401/2511_665403/202202/t20220210_10640952.html), adding that the “in-orbit Chinese astronauts were facing real and urgent safety threats.”

 “The United States is unaware of any contact or attempted contact by China with the United States Space Command, the operators of Starlink-1095 and Starlink-2305 or any other United States entity to share information or concerns about the stated incidents prior to the note verbale from China to the Secretary General,” the Permanent Mission of the U.S. to the U.N. in Vienna said in the document.

End Quote

It could simply be an error due to old satellites having malfunctioned or maybe NASA/SpaceX is not admitting to this and refuting their claims even though China believe it was them who was responsible. Could this be a UAP/ET encounter? It's interesting that the wording states: ""in-orbit Chinese astronauts were facing real and urgent safety threats"". But I don't know if SpaceX would be that dangerous? Considering the censorship around UAP what if these ""satellites"" were actually UAP that are working together with the US or allied with the US somehow or are somehow forced to work for the US?

190,aliens,The Coincidence Theory: how a CIA affiliate involved in the Bay of Pigs and possibly the JFK Assassination led Ross Coulthart to confirmation of a UAP reverse engineering program.,"I’ve been trawling through the latest release of declassified Kennedy assassination documents over the last few weeks, looking for connections to the fabled MJ compartment, nicknamed “**Majestic Jehovah**”. I’m doing this in the hope that the declassification review board may have missed some references, similar to the way the **MK** compartment **ULTRA** mind control projects’ incoming and outgoing expenses were overlooked when CIA Director Richard Helms ordered all of the compartment’s documents be destroyed in 1972.

[JFK Assassination Records - 2021 Additional Documents Release | National Archives](https://www.archives.gov/research/jfk/release2021)

Last night I ran out of things to search for, so I picked up **Ross Coulthart’s** ***In Plain Sight*** book once again and flicked through it. I stopped upon Chapter 22, which was entitled “*Gordon Novel – Fact or Fiction”*. Reading the first few pages of that chapter, I realized that here was a new person to search for in the database. And wouldn’t you know, Gordon popped up in the files.

[docid-32402028.pdf (archives.gov)](https://www.archives.gov/files/research/jfk/releases/2021/docid-32402028.pdf)

The document in question is pretty devoid of relevant information regarding UFOs; however, it is interesting who wrote and reviewed it and the comments they left in the margins of such a seemingly innocuous document. The author was **Donovan E. Pratt**, who at the time was the **Deputy Chief of Counter Intelligence, Research and Analysis for the CIA.** His boss, **Raymond G. Rocca,** signed the routing sheet and commented “*these need to be sanitized*”. Others commented, “*because these data are sensitive from the viewpoint of CCS please restrict access to this info to yourself and DCI”* (**Director of Central Intelligence, Richard Helms**). The CIA’s **General Counsel, Lawrence Houston,** also wrote: “*as per above note*”. CCS refers to Central Cover Staff, the section of CIA that creates front companies and cover stories for clandestine work by field officers. Why would such an unimportant person such as Novel’s call records to an answering service require the Director CIA and other organizational heavy hitters to keep the data to themselves? Rocca, one of **Jim Angleton’s** closest confidantes and the person who authored the CIA's narrative to the **Warren Commission** (and committed perjury whilst doing so), classified the document as **Secret** and it was only declassified in full in **November 2021.**

Ross Coulthart doesn’t give too much credence to Novel’s various claims and describes him as a “Walter Mitty” type. However, other actual CIA insiders said that he did indeed have high-level CIA and military contacts, but “his biggest problem was keeping his mouth shut”. Of course, the document I refer to above was not fully available in unredacted form until AFTER Coulthart’s book was published.

Digging a little deeper, I found that the CIA had ***very*** **good reasons to restrict information** about Novel:

1. Novel was involved with the CIA **Bay of Pigs** team, assisting in stealing explosives from a local oil and gas company (as Ross points out in his book)
2. Novel ran an electronics firm in New Orleans that specialized in selling equipment used for bugging. His lawyer claimed he held a position identical to that of **E. Howard Hunt**, an intermediary between the Cuban exiles and the CIA. After initially denying that he had had any part in the burglary, he stated that ""*It was one of the most patriotic burglaries in history,*"" and that it was done under the direction of the CIA as part of the Bay of Pigs operation. Novel confessed he had been given a key to the bunker and that the people he had met there, Arcacha Smith and **David Ferrie** were also working for the CIA.""
3. From the get-go of the Castro takedown plans, Novel was associated with a CIA front company called “**Double Chek Corporation**”. During the planning of the Bay of Pigs invasion, Howard Hunt also worked for Double-Chek, a dummy electronics firm located just outside Miami. Another notable employee of Double Chek was **Barry Seale**, of “Made in America” fame.
4. Novel also worked with the propaganda end of the invasion. As a director of a CIA front called the **Evergreen Advertising Agency**, he was responsible for transmitting cryptographic messages to alert the exiles to the invasion date. Hunt was in charge of domestic propaganda for the Bay of Pigs operation and was probably Novel's superior.
5. According to William Torbitt Novel had been seen by a Dallas attorney having meetings with **Jack** **Ruby** and William Seymour in the Carousel Club during October and November 1963. Another author, Paris Flammonde (The Kennedy Conspiracy), claims that Novel was questioned on five separate occasions following the assassination of John F. Kennedy.
6. Novel was subpoenaed by the Garrison Inquiry but managed to dodge the witness stand. He called Garrison’s claim of a CIA conspiracy in the JFK assassination “a fraud”.
7. J.Edgar Hoover stated the following:” *On 4/25/67 Mr. Howard Osborn, Director of Security, CIA, informed the Bureau's liaison representative that Gordon Novel's alleged claim that he was associated with is completely false. Mr. Osborn stated that Gordon Novel, David William Ferrie and Sergio Arcacha Smith have never been of operational interest to CIA. He also stated that the Evergreen Advertising has no connection whatsoever with CIA.*” (This narrative is later proven false, and Evergreen was a CIA front company).
8. Whilst he was away avoiding Garrison, a cleaner found the following note in Novel’s room, believed to be addressed to his CIA handler Mr Weiss:

*I took the liberty of writing you direct and apprising you of current situation, expecting you to forward this through appropriate channels. Our connection and activity of that period involves individuals presently about to be indicted as conspirators in Garrison's investigation.... Garrison has subpoenaed myself and an associate to testify before his grand jury on matters which may be classified* ***TOP SECRET***. *Actions of individuals connected with* ***DOUBLE-CHEK CORPORATION*** *in Miami in first quarter of 1961.*

*We have no current contact available to inform of this situation. So I took the liberty of writing you direct and apprising you of current situation. Expecting you to forward this through appropriate channels.*

*Our connection and activity of that period involves individuals presently about to be indicted as conspirators in Mr. Garrison's investigation.*

*We have temporarily avoided one subpoena not to reveal Double Chek activities or associate them with this mess. We want out of this thing before Thursday 3/67. Our attorneys have been told to expect another subpoena to appear and testify on this matter. The fifth amendment and/or immunity (and) legal tactics will not suffice.*

*Mr. Garrison is in possession of unsworn portions of this testimony. He is unaware of Double-Chek's involvement in this matter but has strong suspicions. I have been questioned extensively by local FBI recently as to whether or not I was involved with Double-Chek's parent holding corporation during that time. My reply on five queries was negative. Bureau unaware of Double-Chek association in this matter. Our attorneys and others are in possession of complete sealed files containing all information concerning matter. In the event of our sudden departure, either accidental or otherwise, they are instructed to simultaneously release same for public scrutiny in different areas simultaneously.*

*Appropriate counteraction relative to Garrison's inquisition concerning us may best handled through military channels vis a vis D.I.A. man. Garrison is presently colonel in Louisiana Army National Guard and has ready reserve status. Contact may be had through our attorneys of current record, Plotkin, Alverez, Sapir.*

9. Novel’s expertise in electronics and eavesdropping devices and close contact with CIA operatives naturally lead to his involvement in Watergate with fellow bugging expert **James McCord** and his old boss **E. Howard Hunt**.

[Gordon Novel (spartacus-educational.com)](https://spartacus-educational.com/JFKnovel.htm)

10. Hunt starts to extort the Nixon administration whilst awaiting sentencing for his part in Watergate, claiming he has evidence of Nixon’s involvement in the JFK assassination via his authorization of **ZRRIFLE** and membership of the **40 Committee**, a secret team of high-level government officers (a sub-committee of **MJ-12**?). In fact, the following excerpt of the Watergate Tapes captures **President Richard Nixon** saying the following: ""*...just say (unintelligible) very bad to have this fellow Hunt, ah, he knows too damned much, if he was involved -- you happen to know that? If it gets out that this is all involved, the Cuba thing, it would be a fiasco. It would make the CIA look bad, it's going to make Hunt look bad, and it is likely to blow the whole* ***Bay of*** ***Pigs thing*** *which we think would be very unfortunate - both for the CIA and for the country...""* In his autobiography “The Ends of Power” (written whilst serving his prison sentence), former Nixon political aide **H.R. Halderman** claimed the **Bay of Pigs reference was a codeword used by Nixon to refer to the JFK assassination.**

11. Hunt’s wife **Dorothy**, also ex-CIA, became the ""bag-lady"" for the extortion money from Nixon et. al. and began paying off those involved to keep them quiet. **She was killed, along with 46 other people**, when her plane crashed en-route to delivering the cash. [DOROTHY HUNT'S DEATH (whokilledjfk.net)](http://whokilledjfk.net/dorothy_hunt.htm)

12. After the plane carrying Hunt's wife Dorothy crashed under mysterious circumstances in December 1973, the chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board told the House Government Activities Subcommittee that he had sent a letter to the FBI which stated that over fifty agents came into the crash zone. **The FBI denied everything** until William Ruckleshaus became temporary Director, at which time they admitted that their agents were on the scene. The Independent researcher Sherman Skolnick believes that Dorothy Hunt was carrying documents that **linked Nixon to the Kennedy assassination.** According to Skolnick these papers, which were being used to blackmail Nixon, **were seized by the FBI**. Skolnick's theory is corroborated by a conversation that allegedly took place between Charles Colson and Jack Caufield. [Alan J. Weberman (spartacus-educational.com)](https://spartacus-educational.com/JFKweberman.htm)

**So, what has this got to do with UFOs?** Well, as Ross points out in his book, Novel was also the author of ***The Supreme Cosmic Secret- How the U.S. Government Reverse Engineered an Extra-terrestrial Spacecraft.*** **Somehow**, **Novel had gotten wind of a crash retrieval (perhaps after a few drinks with CIA personnel briefed into the CIA's MJ compartment)** and arranged a meeting with the **US Navy’s Director of Science and Technology Development** (taking his son along with him). Novel died in 2012, but Ross managed to track down his son, who remembered the name of the Navy Director – it was **Nat Kobitz,** and we all know who he was.

And here is the **most fantastic part of this story**: **that this is all merely “A COINCIDENCE”** – a guy that is an affiliate to **ALL** of the CIA’s most nefarious activities of the 1960s, whose involvement with the CIA is kept quiet by the **highest echelons** of The Agency, also claims to have knowledge of a **Reverse Engineering program** and just happens to know the exact doors to knock on in the Pentagon (how did he even get into the Pentagon?).

**We have now arrived at the** ***Coincidence Theory***, and the mental gymnastics required to think that these are a happenstance lineup of random events are tortuous, to say the least.\*\*

In Coulthart’s book, he explains that Novel approached Kobitz in 1993 with a diagram of what he called the **Alien Reproduction Vehicle (ARV) Fluxliner** – an anti-gravity propelled machine. The diagram was purported to have been drawn by a professional aerospace illustrator named **Mark McCandlish**, and was later used as testimony at the Disclosure Project hearing at the National Press Club in 2001 as evidence of a secret U.S. Government reverse engineering program. When asked about the Fluxliner, Coulthart states that Koblitz believed it to be a hoax, but later discloses that he had been read into a Waivered Unacknowledged Special Access Program (WUSAP) compartmented program that was indeed tasked with reverse engineering a craft that was “**not of this world”.**

Now, let's look at [this](https://youtu.be/bfJUciAxxyo).
There are more videos like this one – robotic animals with cameras inside them ""spy"" on real animals. Like in the video above, animals usually see that something isn't exactly right, but they keep going, assuming that the robotic animal is just a bit weird. They don't understand us or the technology that we use, so they would never think that this odd animal is a robot, their minds aren't capable of such things.

So there's the question – if we do this to animals, why aliens wouldn't do this to us, especially that they have superior technology and they are likely capable of making compelling human robot? Even if said robot acts strange or unnatural, most people would think you are crazy, if you think that there are robots planted by aliens walking among us.

196,aliens,The general narrative,"So, as far out and un-believable as it sounds (which I will co-inside with, in saying that I don't fully believe, or say could be proven at this time to be completely factual or true), is there seems to be some kind of general narrative here, that I have come across in more than one instance, and would really like to hear what your guys' opinion is on all of this.

This narrative says that although our universe may very well be around 14 billion years old, the actual age of the multiverse in which we reside, may be trillions upon trillions, or even infinitely years old.  And a significantly large portion of our universe (around 1/4, including our planet, and the entire galaxy for that matter), has been under the control of a kind of ""expeditionary force"" that our language can only translate to be called ""the domain"". Before them though, our galaxy had been under the control of what they call the ""old empire"" (draconian?), and it was only after a series of quite literal ""star wars"", that our portion of the universe had fallen from the old empire, which was universally speaking, not too long ago. (about 10 million years ago).

And when it comes to the most common, generic type of et that our planet interacts with (the grays), they can really be more easily compared to a kind of ""contractor group"", who each have the ability to transfer their conciousness's into various different kinds of non-biological body types, that are more well suited for space/time travel. And so depending on whatever role, or job that each of them are instructed to do, some might be shorter or taller than others, and some, (like pilots), might not even have a mouth, nose, or ears, yet have large eyes, that are more useful for their task at hand. 

This theory would also answer why most of the different kinds of craft that we have recovered don't seem to have any kind of analog, hand held operational equipment, because it is the conseousness of the ets themselves, who have the ability to directly connect with, and operate the craft through purely the use of their minds.

There's more info about our planet that I've come across that is related to all of this aswell, but I think it's best that I maybe save all of that for another time.

197,aliens,What gain would any government or agency have for fabricating the idea of aliens?,"I aim to start a discussion here based from some questions that i have regarding alien life and whether or not it has all been fabricated since the rising popularity of space and space travel since the 1940’s. The idea of aliens as we know it started in this era, with the Roswell crash blowing the idea into the mainstream, but before this there has always been the idea of demons/entities visiting earth from non-earthly places, which we had little to no understanding of aside from religious texts, but the modern and common idea of aliens is that they are small beings with some human like features, and this concept for what aliens look like only began AFTER the mass interest in space. This piece of information holds a lot of value in my opinion to whether the idea of aliens has been fabricated, but of course in more recent years, agencies such as the American government have ‘leaked’ documents suggesting that there are crafts located within government facilities and so on. My real question is, why would the concept of aliens only come around after discovering that there are likely to be other inhabitable planets, and if it is all a large scale hoax, why would we not know about it by now? I hope this makes sense and I wish to see unbiased and backed up information for why any of it would be fabricated, whether that be theories on how the government used aliens as an excuse to do random drug testing on civilians or whatever information/speculations people possess for this matter.

201,aliens,Followed Lue's Breadcrumbs To Find The Message In Our DNA,"On 21 October 2021, ""Theories of Everything"" producer Curt Jaimungal [interviewed](http://youtu.be/wULw64ZL1BG?t=2430) [Luis Elizondo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luis_Elizondo). During the interview Mr. Elizondo highlighted the fact that one could place a message in DNA that could survive for millions of years; and alluded that such a message exists. Although discussed for a short time, no effort was publicly announced by either independent or organizational researchers to verify or refute his claims. Given the ramifications if such a message did in fact exist, despite the minuscule chance of a positive finding, it was deemed worthwhile to independently apply some analytic effort and computational resources to determine if his comments held merit. 


What was found?


TLDR Version:


Despite a strong statistical improbability, significant portions of the non-coding sections of the genomes of multiple species (including Homo Sapiens) are found to generate [Three-Dimensional Toruses](https://web.archive.org/web/20220213201326if_/https://i.imgur.com/a5SqvgU.gif) with a One-Half Mobius twist per face interconnect when 64-base sequences are mapped into a cubic structure.  


The nature of this mathematical structure may lead to a large-scale [3D-Torus interconnect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torus_interconnect) that is self-ordering, self-orienting, and self-error detecting.  The fact that this mathematical structure is found pervasively through our DNA needs to be examined and verified or refuted by statisticians, mathematical topologists, geneticists, computer scientists, information theorists, computational biologists, and informatics experts in academia and the public sector.  


It is assumed what was found is a container or wrapper for a message.  The message contents themselves were not found or interpreted.  It will take significant effort to reconstruct the message fragments found in what could be billions of message containers across millions of species. 


The analysis made no attempt to determine who or what placed messages into the DNA of, what was later found to be, multiple species that include humans. Nor does the analysis dismiss that the structure could be naturally occurring. Despite no apparent natural selective pressure; there could be some molecular machinery that prefers to pervasively generate 64-base, 3-Torus with 1/2 Mobius twist mathematical structures.

203,aliens,"If you assume aliens exist, you have to assume they’re here/watching us.","The universe is 13 billion years old. human civilisation only arose at most 8 thousand years ago. modern science is maybe 500 years old, with the industrial revolution taking place just 200 years ago. this is nothing. but look at what we have done in that tiny amount of time. 

we’ve put a man on the moon, there is a drone flying around on mars and the voyager probe is interstellar. remember - this is after 500 years of science. a fraction of a blink of the eye compared to the age of the universe. more importantly however - we accomplished all of that in just 1 lifetime. there were people alive during the American civil war that witnessed Neil Armstrong take those first steps.

so if all goes well on earth, given the exponential growth of technology, we could assume we will have our solar system colonised in a couple hundred years. then in say 1000 years we’ll probably have a few small outposts around other stars. and from that point on the human seed will spread like wildfire across the cosmos. it’s completely realistic that in just a million years we will have touched every corner of the galaxy and mapped every star. 

The universe is billions of years old, so if aliens do exist they will have certainly done exactly the same. they will know about us, period. and if they know about us, they are probably here observing us just as we observe primitive tribes. thats what we would do if we found a less advanced civilisation out in the cosmos. 

one last point i have to mention, is yes they absolutely would be interested in us. it isn’t arrogant to assume so. this is a common argument against alien visitation - “why would they care about us? they will view us as nothing more than an anthill”. now to be devil’s advocate, it’s entirely possible that a civilisation millions or possibly billions of years old may view us the same way we look at ants. 

but guess what? we know about ants. we know more about ants than they know about themselves. this is simply because we like to look at and understand things for no other reason than expanding our knowledge about the world around us. a defining trait of intelligence is curiosity. if a civilisation has developed interstellar crafts you have to assume they value curiosity and sharing knowledge. so the idea that they would take one look at earth and say “meh, too primitive for me, such a boring species” is ludicrous. even if we are your average standard civilisation out of millions, we will still be incredibly unique and worth observation. 

Long story short we are absolutely being visited by extraterrestrials and the evidence is just use of logical thinking.",st3yek,243,,1644934674.0,175,0.78
204,aliens,"Since at least 1873, ships sailing in the Indian Ocean, anywhere between the Persian Gulf to the South China Sea, have reported a mile wide disc passing under their vessels with huge 30 meter wide lights rotating like spokes on a wheel.","Edit: These reports were filed with the US Hydrographic Office. The office was established by an act of 21 June 1866 as part of the Bureau of Navigation, Department of the Navy. It was transferred to the Department of Defense on 10 August 1949. The office was abolished on 10 July 1962, replaced by the Naval Oceanographic Office.

The reports from US sources may have stopped when the DoD took over but an Australian report from 1964 popped up as well.

*March 23, 1873.* The Adelheid sailed over something in the South China Sea that lit up the ocean under that ship for over an hour. This might be the earliest report of this massive circular object in that part of the world.



*May 15, 1879.* The HMS Vulture saw a large ""Ferris Wheel"" spinning in the east, and a second one spinning in the opposite direction to the west. The ""spokes"" are 25 feet wide and spaces are 100 feet wide.



*January 5, 1880.*  R. E. Harris, Commander of the S.S. Shahjehan described the massive Ferris Wheel under a perfectly calm sea near India's Malabar Coast.



*May 1880*. THe British India Co. ship ""Patna"" saw the undersea ""Ferris Wheel"" and counted 16 spokes at 300 yards long. I've think I've got a good idea of the dimensions now with the previous describes 25 foot width of each spoke.


*October 1891.* Again in the South China Sea. A correspondent saw shafts of light that had had the appearance of rays of a searchlight, and that had moved in a circular motion. 


*April 4, 1901*. Persian Gulf, Captain Hoseason, of SS Kilwa, saw vast shafts of light from the Ferris Wheel USO. Shaft followed shaft upon the surface of the sea revolving at a velocity of about 60 miles an 
hour.



*June 2, 1906*. Douglas Carnegie saw, in the Gulf of Oman, he saw ""shafts of brilliant light sweeping across the ship's bows at 60 up to 200 miles an hour. These light bars were about 20 feet apart and most regular."" 



*Marxh 13, 1907*. Mr. S. C. Patterson of SS Delta in Malacca Strait, 2 A.M.""... saw shafts which seemed to move round a center--like the spokes of a wheel--and appeared to be about 300 yards long."" Lasted about half an hour, while the ship traveled 6 or 7 miles.



*June 10, 1909*. As reported in Scientific American, Crew of the S.S. Bintang saw in the Straits of Malacca a USO under the surface, spinning, with shafts of light coming off of a central hub. It was so big the crew could only see half of it before the horizon.



*August 12, 1910*. It appears the same rotating UFO/USO with rotating, outward-facing shafts of light was seen northwest of the sighting above, this time in the South China Sea by the Dutch steamer Valentijn. This time it was above the water. Reported to Danish Meteorological Instit.



*August 24, 1911.* The same USO was seen for an hour and a half by Capt. Tellefson of the steamship Solva in the Gulf of Thailand (fka Gulf of Siam). 




*1943.* Persian Gulf; Seaman Matthew Mangle, from the bow of his ship, sighted a huge disc beneath the surface of the water. The object, glowing with a soft, greenish light, paced the ship at about 12 knots before speeding up and moving out of sight. 



*Nov 4, 1949*.  Commamder Bodler of the USS Seaveteran saw three massive wheel shaped UFOs in the Straight of Hormuz. This makes appx 75 years of sightings so far.



*April 4, 1951.* The ""Sheila,"" while sailing to Djibouti, saw the same half-mile wide horizontal ""ferris wheel"" pass under her hull, lit 30' wide ""spokes"" casting the hull's shadow on her sails every few minutes as it rotated & passed to the west.



*Nov. 30 1951*. Capt Baker of the M.V. ""British Premier"" while sailing in the south Persian Gulf reported two, 2-mile-wide disks (as usual with lit sections) spinning under the ship, which was above the point where the two nearly intersected.

205,aliens,Human looking Aliens? Humanoid aliens?,"So I've always thought that Aliens are out there, I mean they have to be with this massive Universe and possibly hundreds of thousands of habitable planets in the Milky Way Galaxy alone.

So for me the Christian Bible talks about God making man in his own image and how he provided a male with a female and a female with a male... So this begs the question for Christians who believe Aliens (and none christian obviously) do you think Aliens would look like a humanoid?

Take Star Wars for example, multiple Aliens look Human but with an alien look to them, the Twi'lek are a perfect example.

So if God made other Species then would he make them in his own image but also making them different than Humans to make the Universe a little more diverse from Humans? Or would he just make otherworldly looking Aliens, each looking strange like the classic long, skinny, grey Aliens?

206,aliens,The chances of us being some kind of alien experiment are probably GREATER than us being totally organic.,"If we think about the fact that the universe has been around for 13.8 billion years (as far as we currently know / can see right now) and Earth being approximately 4.54 billion years old, judging by the sheer size of the universe it would be more surprising to me to find out life is rare than if life was common throughout the universe.


Now assuming life is common in the universe and the fact that humans evolved over only 6 Million, it would make sense that there has been plenty of intelligent life in the universe way before earth was even inhabited by life. 


This makes me believe that the universe has probably been vastly mapped / explored by other civilisations within the other 7.5 billion years before earth even existed, and most likely habitable exo planets would be used for alien experiments.

It departed in the same zig-zagging fashion as the now well-known movement of the ""Tic Tac"" as described by Cmdr. David Fravor.","Mr. C. Lethbridge was walking to his Roland Street, Cardiff home, via the 271-meter-high Caerphilly Mountain. As he did so, Lethbridge was astonished by the sight of a cigar-shaped vehicle – in excess of forty-feet in length – which was sitting on the grass, at the edge of a mountain road. In his own words:

 “When I turned the bend at the summit I was surprised to see a long tube-shaped affair on the grass on the roadside, with two men busily engaged with something nearby. They attracted my close attention because of their peculiar getup; they appeared to have big heavy fur coats and fur caps fitting tightly over their heads. I was rather frightened, but I continued to go on until I was within twenty yards of them, and then my idea as to their clothing was confirmed.

 “The noise of my little spring cart seemed to attract them, and when they saw me they jumped up and jabbered furiously to each other in a strange lingo — Welsh or something else; it was certainly not English. They hurriedly collected something off the ground, and then I was really frightened. The long thing on the ground rose up slowly. I was standing still at the time, quite amazed, and when it was hanging a few feet off the ground the men jumped into a kind of little carriage suspended from it, and gradually the whole affair and the men rose in the air in a zigzag fashion. When they had cleared the telegraph wires that pass over the mountain, two lights like electric lamps shone out, and the thing went higher into the air, and sailed away towards Cardiff.”

The object was also later seen by a police officer passing over the city of Peterborough, Cambridgeshire.

They would say a Russian sub would be on station and then from all sides it would begin to hear Kvakers which would unsettle the crew and captain because they felt they had been detected when all indications were they had not been detected, and least by Americans.

During the cold war there were running battles where the Russians thought the unknown UFO - USO were American and the Americans and NATO thought they were the Russians.

Interesting because no one on the Nimitz has mentioned the under sea aspect of the Nimitz carrier battle group at sea as it pertains to these very weird and unusual sounds. Only the Air - Favor aspect of the UFO engagement has been released.

Having watched to this video I could better understand the term ""Somber"" because it clearly indicates they are dealing with an unknown undersea and airborne party which is ""NOT HUMAN"" and far beyond human technology as least as understood and spoken about publicly by the Russian Military.

The Kvakers sound is unsettling

I watched this a long time ago and my feeling has changed. I take away from this watching it again that another species shares the planet with us.

Anyone ever hear anything from the US Navy about the croakers? The Russians encountered thousands of them all under the ocean. The Russian would plot and chart them but they were never static and always moving.

That was creepy AF when you don't know if they're saying Hi or saying Go Away.

Imagine a hominid life form that sought shelter under the oceans 750,000 years ago and they're still down there having adapted to that environment as compared to having perhaps evolved on the surface so long ago. And the Navies of the world think they're going to kick their ass.

In searching for additional facts, I found the news report of that submarine in Indonesia that was found broken in three pieces on the ocean floor.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS\_Scorpion\_(SSN-589)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Scorpion_(SSN-589)) <--- this one happened at a time during the cold war.

I went through a list of all submarine accidents. One which was discussed involved a surface ship, submarine, and an undersea object. I haven't quite found it but thought it was more recent, in retrospect it may have occurred in the mid-late 1940 around Indonesia.

The US Navy Submarine the USS Scorpion (SSN-589) was revealed to have **two antisubmarine nuclear Mark 45 torpedoes** in it's bow section. This was during the height of the cold war and the highly advanced undersea Kvaker people really have a serious problem with humans and their use of nuclear weapons it seems. Call me naive but so do I.

>*Scorpion was lost with all hands on 22 May 1968. She is one of two nuclear submarines the U.S. Navy has lost, the other being USS Thresher. She was one of the four mysterious submarine disappearances in 1968, the others being the Israeli submarine INS Dakar, the French submarine Minerve, and the Soviet submarine K-129.*

Of note, the Iranian fighter pilot who was forced to eject from his aircraft only had to do so once he attempted to actively engage and go weapons hot on the UFO.

215,aliens,For Those That Are Interested...,"So, I know I'm going to get a lot of hate for this. But, I also know there are those of you out there who will love this. I am prepared to deal with the assholes of society, so that I may bring this to you all, in the hopes that there are those of you among this crowd that are open to the idea of using consciousness as a gateway to making contact with Extraterrestrials. 

#This one's for you.

First thing you need to understand is that ETs are real, and they exist in both a physical and nonphysical space. They understand consciousness a lot better than we do, and they have been able to create technology that allows them to have quite a lot of fun with it. They can take you to the past, present, and future, and show you many things that can change the way you live your life. 

You must also understand that our consciousness has energy centers. They exist throughout our bodies, and they control different aspects of our daily life depending on how freely their energies flow. The ancients knew of these, and they called them ""Chakras"". 

In order to make contact this way, you need to know how to ""unlock"" these energy centers, and you have to learn how to familiarize yourself with each of their corresponding aspects of what makes you, ""You"". If you're interested, there are many different guided meditations on YouTube that you can choose from yourself on how to do this. 

- As for the meditation itself:

I go to a nice, quiet space, and I make myself as comfortable as I can. Either sitting on my couch, on my yoga mat, or in my chair. You can even do it outside I the forest or by a river. The location is up to you, as long as you can be in a safe location, with little distractions. *This is key.* This way, you can concentrate on your connection to the ETs. 

Once I have my safe space, I clear my mind, and focus on my intention. Ask yourself, ""What is it that you want out of this? Why do you want to make contact?"" 

Focusing on my intention allows me to concentrate on a single thought, and allow the rest of my mind to be as clear and receptive as possible to any messages that come through. *yes, they will talk to you telepathically*. 

For example, I do this in search of gaining knowledge and understanding of the universe. So, I keep this thought in my mind and I repeat to myself, ""I seek Knowledge and Understanding"". I focus on this intention, breathing in what I need, and exhaling the thoughts I dont. Once I have a clear mind, I can then ground myself, and become One with my intention, and use it as a beacon to send out into the universe when I am ready. 

Visualization helps tremendously here. I like to visualize that I'm rooting myself into the ground and spreading out to connect myself with my surroundings. Then, I take all of my focus, and I put everything that I can into visualizing a pillar of light coming out of my forehead (third eye). With this pillar of light, I send out my intention with it, and I firmly state, ""I open myself up to any benevolent being who wishes to do the same"". 

- As for my experiences with CE5, I've met many friendly beings, so feel free to ask me anything. I've posted here before and talked about it my previous posts. 

Additional Edit: Furthermore, I should touch on the fact that this is technically dangerous. You could unintentionally invite unwanted guests. So please be careful and understand that this needs to come from a place of love. Because the Law of Attraction is real. If you come at this with anger and distrust, you might not get anything, or you could invite someone to come prove you wrong in ways you might not like. 

This is why it important to respect this method of contact, and to respect the beings you want to make contact with. 

Nobody likes an asshole.

TLDR: CE5 works, and you just need to meditate

218,aliens,"Lue Elizondo. Chris Melon, to the Stars","Since at least the 1940’s, elements of the government and private industry have been lying to the public about their knowledge of and interaction with UAP, EBE’s and related phenomena. Originally the government began hiding the facts under the auspices of National Security but now the secret has become too great to justify keeping it from the public. Now these officials are faced with an enormous quandary. How to begin revealing this information while at the same time avoiding intense scrutiny, personal attack and potentially even prison. While those currently in charge did not create this difficult situation, at the very least they’ve perpetuated the lie. For them, ‘disclosure’ is a Pandora’s Box. 

What to do in this difficult position?? 

One answer could be to recruit a team consisting of respected government officials and civilians and give them the mandate to execute a ‘slow roll’ disclosure to the public. The public facing members of this team might include: a career Army counter intelligence officer known for his ability to keep secrets and follow orders, a respected former DOD official from a prominent American family and a retired Gen X rocker. The team would then (unknowing in some cases) use the public guise of ‘calling on the government to increase their scrutiny and take seriously’ the UAP situation.  The real goal? To slowly  introduce the facts to the public over a long period of time in such a way that they’re slowly acclimated and distracted at the same time (counter intelligence). That might be one way I’d like to see it done if I were head of a 3 lettered government organization or a CEO of a defense contractor who’d be hoarding advanced technology for personal financial gain.

I have spoken about this numerous times on this sub. But this it's different. I'm definitely not saying don't be spiritual or have woo beliefs at all. I'm just saying we don't know. For all we know, people could be calling Russians, Chinese, or Americans woo or spiritual beings this whole time lol. And if UAPs are aliens. What happens if we find an alien race that is dumber than us or less capable than us. Do they still qualify as spiritual beings, higher beings, or gods?

During this whole UAP journey. I found a lot of atheists and agnostics who follow this topic. When I realized it. Atheists and agnostics are more likely to be neutral towards UAPs/UFOs or the existence of aliens. What I mean by neutral is that the common atheist/agnostics wouldn't think aliens are gods, spiritual beings, or higher beings. They would have no problem with an alien race worshiping the son. Because aliens just other animals and people to them.

 I believe this has something to do with the difference between none religious people and religious people. Religious people claim they get the answers to the universe. While none religious people say they have no answers. This is true. You can ask the most hardcore asshole atheist who created the big bang. And their response will be ""I don't know"". While the common Christian or Muslim would tell you their God created the big bang. One side thinks they have the answers. While the other side is confident enough to say they don't know.

This is an analogy for UAPs/UFOs and spiritual people. What I mean by analogy is that we don't know what aliens are. We don't know their goals, wants, and needs. That's why I buck heads with woo people and spiritual people a lot. In this case woo is like religion. They claim to have the answers for aliens. When the answer is just their human worldview. Let me repeat that. Your human worldview. In a universe that can possibly have 1 trillion alien races. I'm sure the universe isn't going to revolve around the human concept of spirituality or woo. Does CE5 make the whole universe spin?

All im saying is that people let their personal beliefs dictate what aliens are. If you are Christian or Muslim, you think aliens are Demons or Fallen Angels, or Jin. If you are vegan you think aliens are environmentalists who care about the earth's health. If you are a hippie, do you think we can contact aliens via DMT... I mean CE5. If you are atheist or agnostic then you have no high expectations for aliens.

I remember Lou Elizondo saying he believes in an afterlife. And he is religious IIRC. But he said that was just his opinion. He make sure he said that was his opinion. Because he doesn't want his opinion to distract people from the UAP topic. I kinda wish more people in the community were like this. Just like how skeptics can't know everything. The same logic should apply to spiritual and woo people too.

A spiritual person is no different from a closed-minded skeptic person who 100 percent denied woo beliefs without listening to proof. When that spiritual person does the same thing too. By 100 percent denying any science behind UAPs/UFOs and aliens.

I put a big emphasis on the word HUMAN for a reason. Just we can't understand alien technology. Because we are limited to the HUMAN experience. We can't understand their view on consciousness, spirituality, or lack thereof too. Because we only know how to be HUMAN, not alien. So of course we are going to see everything through a HUMAN lens. Both scientific and spiritual.

In conclusion

I just think the existence of aliens is a lot more bigger than our HUMAN worldviews. And people should sperate their personal HUMAN beliefs from the topic more often.",srqf7z,13,,1644779716.0,23,0.85

221,aliens,Crazy Supposition - War Forces Disclosure by the Aliens Themselves,"Hypothetical

What if the current situation in the Ukraine, and the massive wave of Q-Mental Illness and continued international tensions - a country decides to launch nukes?

The Keepers, our alien friends, would not allow nuclear war to happen. I’ve been reading and watching this subject for 20 years and I have seen many many instances of nuclear armaments being disarmed when there’s a saucer evident in the immediate vicinity.

I wonder, that because their interference will be forced to be overt, that definitive disclosure will happen. ‘Their’ presence will undeniable.

Maybe the shit state of affairs in the world, and the many conflicts brewing which have been manufactured by international bad actors, will force a conflict which ‘they’ll’ stop. Because from everything I’ve read and heard about The Keepers, they’re benevolent and they love the Earth and won’t let us destroy something that is essentially theirs, and essentially so beautiful, so soulful, so magnificent.

We don’t own this Earth, in a Galactic Federation sense. Would you stand by and watch your idiot tenants destroy something as beautiful as the Earth? 

No. No they won’t. 

Earth Governments have already broken agreements with the Galactic Federation.

222,aliens,ORB Flying -- This is an example of what I am filming and seeing in my videos. You decide.,"I have mentioned before that I cannot get a clear image of the orbs that I film, as hard as I try.  They are like translucent or opaque.  My conclusion from what I have determined, I believe that this type of beings are spiritual, good spirits, pure energy, or even possibly light energy.

Note:  Best viewed if you download and slow the speed of the videos on a computer or your phone.

[First video is the raw footage of the second video:](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ecOgeYfeSSPt4YQ7jQsVWruemAYFxIaV/view?usp=sharing)  Download the video and slow down the video.  Orb appears towards the end of the video.  The object you will see comes in from the right screen, under the sun, and then moves off to the left.  It is translucent.

[Second video has been modified:](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SEjU0D_KoEK1dCjyHIGxN3vECnho89uB/view?usp=sharing) Color and lighting changed, zoomed in, and speed extremely slowed down of first video, so you can now see the movement better.

[Third video of orb at night:](https://drive.google.com/file/d/19lK8QYrLcTUgr8fzCFumfaW6Z5KfpzD5/view?usp=sharing)  Captured with night vision infrared binoculars.  Orb appears about 46 seconds into this video and moves across the screen.

[Fourth video of object in light snow:](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gY31Y90m9DTBYpXSVV4gHZDqzF1yvCpA/view?usp=sharing)  Object appears from the right top then drops to the bottom of screen and then appears on the left of the tree and turns and continues moving upward and then goes off screen on the upper left side of screen.  I do not believe snow flakes can do this.

I have witnessed many objects flying at tremendous speeds via the videos I have taken and I believe that these objects are all around the world.  How could they not be at the speeds that they travel.  My recommendation is that each one of you look, very closely, if you want to discover the truth.  From my experience as to what I have filmed and what I have seen, they are definitely real.  I am just sharing, ultimately, each one of you has to decide for yourself.

Edit:  Go check out [Linda Miller](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4iNJK9TLraQcTlU1oDq2yw/videos) on Youtube.  I found this Youtube channel, because I was searching for what rods looked like.  She has caught some orbs which look very similar to what I have filmed, as well as a rod shaped object, like I have too.

Lue isn't just some guy. He is a freaking Government agent talking about aliens on podcasts. But yet this UAP stuff isn't big news. Let me repeat this Lue Elizondo, a Government agent is implying that UFOs/UAPs are aliens in the two links I put in this post. Let that sink in a bit.

You would think there would be more concern by people. Because you know a Government agent thinks UFOs/UAPs are aliens. But I have family who keeps up with the news a lot. But yet they don't know anything about this topic. They don't even know what UAPs are lol.

When I check on YouTube Basketball is trending, when I check on Twitter WW3 is trending, and when I check on Reddit the Metaverse is trending. I feel like only me and a few people in this whole freaking world actually follow this topic lol.

So what im trying to say in this post is. That the lack of coverage on this topic makes me less likely to believe Lue Elizondo. And is making me confused because a Government agent is talking about aliens being real in interviews. But no one seems to even care. 🤷‍♀️

In conclusion. The lack of courage on this topic is so nonexistent that we can't even trust a freaking Government agent who should at least be the most credible and knowledgeable when it comes to this topic. Strange times we are living in right now lol.",srfnjk,50,,1644747598.0,50,0.81
225,aliens,"Woo, Remote viewing, Human potential and alien breeding programmes","From what I hear in the old conspiracy circles,  as a species we are pretty much very psychicly weak hence why most of us aren't aware of it except for the odd one who's ability is naturally slightly higher.

Buuut...

We have one litlle quirk to that ability; while our psychic potency is limited, our range is not. Our ability to remote view can be trained to a high degree apparently.

If true, this could go a ways to explaining our suppression. A united human species with the collective ability to remote view, would pose a huge security risk for any antagonistic galactic power.

Which brings me neatly onto the alien breeding programme issue. The most common narrative threads in abduction accounts are psychic ability, specifically telepathy and genetic manipulative breeding programmes.

If you subscribe to the information provided by regression hypnotic therapist Barbara Lamb in her book ""Meet the Hybrids"", there is two ideological opposed breeding  programmes going on.

On the negative size, there's a programme by competition based non-human entities to co-opt that psychic range into their own being.

On the positive side, there's a programme by cooperation based non-human entities to raised human psychic ability, to provide them a powerful ally against the completion based entities.

If any of this is factual, how does that effect the human species going forward?
Do we choose to be a competion based species, do we choose to be a cooperation based species or do we continue to be a blend of the two?",sresfj,16,,1644744045.0,18,0.86

230,aliens,I believe we are in a spiritual education system.,"I generally subscribe to Jacques Vallee’s hypothesis that the Phenomenon is some sort of control system. The question is- what is that system controlling?

I believe that the Phenomenon adapts to the era in which it presents itself with the express goal of advancing humans spiritually. In Biblical times, both Old and New Testament, in ancient Egypt, in Ancient Greece, in America with Joseph Smith, etc. most of the miraculous and otherworldly happenings in these situations, I believe, can be attributed to the Phenomenon interacting with us. 

The 20th Century was dominated by the steep advancement of science and technology, and along with it a new purely rational way of thinking. This caused a shift away from more spiritual practices, reviewing ancient traditions and teachings as mere myth rather than actual experiences that people had. 

So, now to reach us the Phenomenon needs to show us that what we hold to be absolute truth in Physics is not as true as we believe. We are witnessing what we perceive as craft from other planets that are capable of things that nothing should be. Because of this, I think our scientists will have to gradually grapple with the idea that reality is very different from what we believe, and this will ultimately cause a shift toward more spiritual thinking again.

233,aliens,I had a close encounter of the first kind.,"When I was 15, maybe 16, me and my friend saw something that was terrifying but at the same time awesome. 

It was about 4am, we were playing Left 4 Dead and decide to take a break. We walked outside and after about 10 minutes of sitting and taking about nothing we noticed something was in the sky. There was no noise except the rustling of leaves on the trees in his backyard and when we looked up, there was a strange triangle up there. It was maybe 120 feet up but was pushing the leaves down like a helicopter would. Again, there was no noise other than the leaves. We watched this object for roughly 1 minute before it disappeared behind the tree line. We could tell nothing but the shape and color of lights. It was a triangle shape, again from the bottom of it, and it was illumated with yellowish lights on the bottom like an observation deck. 

We didn't say a word to each other during the display. All we remember is finishing our smokes and going to bed. The next morning we woke up in his room and neither of us said anything about the night before for a long while. Eventually, he asked if I had a weird thing happen last night and I said I had thought I saw something but it had to be because I was tired. He suggested I draw what I thought I saw because he had a strange dream too. We ended up drawing the same ship/object in separate rooms. We talked for a while about what we thought it was but couldn't come up with an explanation on it so we thought it was sleep deprivation. 

When I went to take a shower later that morning, I noticed some strange cuts/bruising I hadn't seen before. Both I and my friend looked and had no idea what had caused it from the night before. 

It may sound like I am completely insane or that I was high as all get out but I swear both of us were sober when all this happened. I'm not sure if I saw an alien or I was dreaming everything.

239,aliens,I saw an injured alien.,"This happened in 2004 and to this day It still bothers me.

I live in Istanbul, Kumburgaz. I have a summer house/ village house near Marmara sea. (10min walk to the beach). One night I woke up to the high pitch humming sound. I checked the clock. It was 3am. I went to the kitchen to get a can of soda. I looked at the windows there was orange light coming from my garden. I immediately took my shotgun went outside to check it. And that’s when I saw the alien looking humanoid. At first I thought he was an intruder. I immediately cocked the gun and asked him who he is and what he is doing in my garden. He didn’t answer. I told him that I will shoot If he doesn’t answer. He still didn’t answer. I went a little closer and that’s when I realised that he was no human. He was still looking at my face. I saw that the alien was wounded. Green liquid was dripping from the wound at his stomach. His height was around 150-160cm but I couldnt tell because he wasnt’t laying straight. He was holding his stomach. He had giant black eyes just like the alien illustrations. But he was looking just innocent. He was wearing a gray uniform with a golden colour belt. His belt was glowing orange from a far. And the humming sound was keep disappearing when he was on eye contact.

I immediately went inside to get my phone. I called the local police and told them there is someone wounded in my garden and I need someone to come here. They told me that I need to call the gendarme since It was not their territory. I hang up and called them. I told them everything. Guy on the phone said do not move and do not talk to him. He won’t hurt you dont worry. He sounded like he knows what the thing in my garden was. I was so scared. I was waiting for them to arrive without moving like I was a statue. 15 min later a black jeep without a license plate arrived. 5 people were in it. They were wearing suits that I have never seen before. I later assumed it was for possible radiation. Commander rushed over the alien and looked at his eyes for 30 min straight without saying anything. I think they communicated telepathicaly. Then he grabbed the alien from the back of his neck just like you do to a dog or cat and put it in the car. The alien was looking at me like he was saying why did you do that to me? What did I do to you to deserve this? But he was not talking.

To this day, I still cannot forget that look he gave to me when they were leaving. I cried so bad. My eyes still would get watery whenever I imagine his last look at me. I have no proof of this. You might ask why didn’t you take a photo? It was 2004. My phone was nokia 3310. To this day I still wonder what would have happened If I haven’t called the gendarme. I just wanted to share it. To be honest, I wouldn't believe If someone shares a story like this without any proof but this is real. I certainly wouldn’t believe any of these alien encounter experiences If this didn’t happen to me. It is up to you to believe or not.

241,aliens,Does anyone else consciously identify Remote Psionic/Telepathic manipulations from an Extraterrestrial or external source regularly?,"The title says it all. I must add I’ve done a fair amount of research on the history of the subject, & it repeatedly mentions government agencies performing specific research on the development of similar types of equipment applied through remote electronic interfaces. I do not actually believe that the majority of the devices  located within humans are engineered by human governments myself & I believe they originate by design from an extraterrestrial source entirely.

I’m essentially here to collect data on the topic. So in a completely safe environment I’m posing the question & try not to read too much into other comments if they reflect a contrary or oppressive belief as I’ve gathered some have deeply ingrained opinions on the topic as being singularly & only related to medical conditions of the brain. (Or quite possibly this exact same mental manipulation equipment)

Within my own comprehension of anecdotal evidence I’ll share the preface I’ve extrapolated. I believe what we are dealing with here on Earth is very similar to an advanced form of programmable computer chip or device. Likely non-invasive or microscopic to such a degree of insignificance, & that it is directly connected to the human brain, brain stem & central nervous system functions entirely, without any detectable routes through traditional medical equipment. I sense these devices are physically powered off of the human body itself. I’ve also concluded their main function Is a vast range of sensory detection, sensory input & connectable control algorithms that will directly mimic brain pattering to the level of deciphering thought processes down to each individual brain component. Essentially all the individual organ functions, all components of motor function, all nerve endings and connections. All components of dreams both waking states and sleep patterning, visualization patterning. All the way to simple aspects such as physical eye movement, emotional states, memory. Anything & everything to do with the brain itself.

So how does one individually detect something that is inherently designed to be literally impossible to disrupt or detect. Well I physically had to go in and break the device essentially to an extent. Through organic approaches, meditations, & specifically re-engineering my brain with (Purple Cabbage), that through repeated consumption will temporarily offset, what appears to be a largely right brain hemisphere operating device, to try to power the device off of a perfectly balanced L-R brain hemisphere down to the level of the induced light frequency emissions of the ultraviolet spectrum temporarily generated by the food. Essentially it just absolutely takes out the devices functionality. So you (or I) ended up with a bunch of electronic beeping & machine failure instead of what is likely naturalized streamlined up to the nanosecond neurological firing of the brain in a cadenced driven L-R fashion. Where L-R under Purple Cabbage influence fire at an absolute value of 1-1. 

So the device for me is somewhat inoperable & completely detectable, making it significantly easier to control because the communication functionality of the mechanisms have fundamentally changed from where maybe base devices for humans have been engineered. This has been an absolute wash of medical science for me entirely. The algorithmic functionality of the devices conscious manipulation is so vast, it’s completely incomprehensible, as if someone hired a five year old to rule the planet. (With all respect to five year olds) Physical objectivity to brain manipulation down to why or when you think (this thought you get an itch here) or why every time I open the (——) my phone gets a text message, biological to machine manipulation from a brain device & you can read through the code line where each component gets programmed so it is as clear as reading a screen with coded lines, it’s functionality is so specific in distraction that i see absolutely no way traditional medical sciences would even be able to start comprehending how such an invasive piece of electronic equipment could be operating such a large volume of people. My sense is You would likely go into a lab while the thing is simultaneously operating the lab equipment you are measuring with, so the results are completely orchestrated.

If you have any individual insights please feel free to share. & I totally comprehend how this may come off as completely arrogant, so with all respect. My only interest it to find the truth.

A simple Yes or No is completely fine

On the night of September 19-20, 1961, the Hills were returning home to Portsmouth, NH, after a vacation at Niagara Falls. Barney, 39, who died in 1969, was a Boston postal clerk. His wife Betty, 41, was a 
state child welfare worker. About 11:00 P.M., as they drove south on U.S. 3 in the vicinity of the White Mountains, they spotted a bright, moving, starlike object in the southwest sky. 


At first moving northward, the object turned toward the couple's car and proceeded to pace it for the next 35 miles (58 km). The Hills stopped the car at intervals to view the UFO through binoculars. It appeared to be a rotating circular object following an erratic, steplike course above the mountains. Finally, around midnight, near North 
Woodstock, the object halted over a clearing to the right. 


Barney stopped the car and got out to observe the apparent craft through binoculars. The UFO then crossed the road ahead silently and hovered above a field on the left. Barney walked into the field for 
a closer look, peering through his binoculars at the tilted object-a large, flattened, disc-shaped craft with a red light on either side and a double row of windows suffused with a bluish-white glow. 


Barney testified that he could see eight or more humanoid figures watching him. A ""leader"" wore a shiny black uniform and a cap; the rest, light-colored shirts. The unknown craft began descending toward Barney, as the figures suddenly scurried around in a flurry of activity. The red lights began sliding out on the tips of finlike structures. The observer was fascinated and at the same time terrified by the 
specter of the ""leader,"" who continued to stare at him. 


Finally, after the object had approached within 100 ft. (30 m) or less, Barney fled in panic toward the car and frantically drove away. The couple recalled hearing-and feeling-strange beeping sounds that vibrated the car twice: once after they sped away and again in the Ashland area 30 miles ( 48 kilometers) to the south. But they were puzzled about why they remembered nothing of the interval between the two sets of ""beeps"" (except a vague memory of turning off Route 3), and why they arrived home at least two hours later than expected. 


Back home in Portsmouth they noted other peculiarities. Both of their watches had stopped. Barney felt oddly compelled to inspect his genitals. He also observed that the tops of his shoes were scuffed. Betty asserted that she packed up her dress and never wore it again. A check of the car revealed a cluster of shiny, circular spots on the trunk that may have been due to a weather or road precipitate. 


About one and a half to two weeks following the sighting, Betty said she dreamed that she and her husband were taken on board the same craft and examined in separate rooms. The dreams were so vivid that Betty said she believed they were recall of an actual experience 
that had occurred after the initial UFO encounter along Route 3. 


Betty reported the UFO sighting to nearby Pease Air Force Base and to NICAP in Washington, DC. NICAP asked me, as one of its New England advisers, to interview the couple. I drove from the Boston area to Portsmouth, and after six hours of questioning, came away impressed with the two witnesses and their incredible account. 


During the next two years, Barney Hill suffered from a variety of anxieties and ailments possibly related to the UFO experience. He returned to an old drinking problem and developed a ring of genital 
warts, an ulcer, and high blood pressure. Betty Hill remained concerned about her abduction dreams. The couple was referred to Boston psychiatrist Benjamin Simon, who hypnotically regressed them between January and June 1964. (Simon died in 1981.) Details of their abduction gradually emerged. 


After the first ""beeps"" on the car, Barney now recalled being instructed telepathically to turn off the highway into a heavily wooded area, a site Betty believes was east of Thornton. A group of humanoid beings blocked their way as the car stalled. They were about 5 ft. (1.5 m) tall with large heads, gray skin, large slanted eyes, small 
noses, and thin mouths. They were clothed in dark uniforms with short coats. The beings approached the stalled car and escorted the couple into the landed UFO and then to separate rooms. 


Betty was left with the ""leader"" and an examiner. She noticed an examination table, stool, cabinet, and walls that glowed bluish-white. Overhead was a bright bluish light. Her arm was inspected under a device with a big lens and then scraped. Samples from her skin, ear, hair, and nails were wrapped up in a plastic-like material and stored in a cabinet drawer. The examiner also looked at her eyes with a handheld 
light and peered at her mouth, throat, and teeth. 


While she lay on the table in her slip, her body was touched all over with a cluster of needles attached to wires and a machine. The examiner then inserted a long needle in her navel, explaining that it was a ""pregnancy test."" When Betty reacted to the pain, the leader seemed surprised and passed his hands over her eyes. The pain disappeared. (Similar procedures, such as amniocentesis, were unknown at the time of the Hill incident.) 


Mrs. Hill said she communicated extensively with the ""leader,"" at least part of the time via telepathic means. Crewmembers were heard to communicate among themselves with a mumbling or humming sound. Betty said she saw a book with symbols arranged in columns, and asked the ""leader"" if she could take it as proof of her experience. But after a while the ""leader"" retrieved it when other crewmembers apparently objected. 


When she asked the ""leader"" where he was from, he went over to the wall and somehow revealed a three-dimensional ""star map"" filled with glowing dots, some of which were connected by curved lines. The ""leader"" explained the links as routes from his home star system to other stars, some of which were visited frequently and others occasionally. Under Dr. Simon's posthypnotic suggestion, Betty later drew 
the star map as she remembered it. 


Toward the end of her experience the examiner and others returned to Betty's room with Barney's false teeth! They were excited and puzzled that his teeth were removable, but hers were not. This led to questions from the examiner about old age, time, food, and colors. 


Meanwhile, Barney recalled lying on a table in his room. He believed a sperm specimen was withdrawn when a cuplike device was 
placed around his genitals. He also felt a cylindrical object inserted in his rectum and something extracted. Like his wife, his arm was scraped for skin cells, and his ears and throat were checked. He said he kept his eyes closed except for a peek at his room, which appeared similar to Betty's. 


After the examinations were over, the Hills were led to their car, where they watched the craft take off. As they drove away, their memories of the abduction faded. Conscious memory returned after the 
second set of ""beeps"" near Ashland. 


Dr. Simon, who professed no interest in the UFO subject, theorized that the abduction scenario was really Betty's dream fantasy shared with her husband. Although communication between the two witnesses probably played some role in the retelling, Webb remain convinced of the reality of both phases of the UFO encounter. Betty's dreams and her more elaborate account of the abduction could be explained by her desire to stay aware and her stubborn refusal to forget the onboard experience. Barney, by contrast, kept his eyes shut and willingly tried to forget. Also, he reported components unique to his examination 
that were not present in Betty's. 


Postscript 


Webb's 60-page report citing the abduction details was written confidentially for NICAP in August 1965. Two months later the Boston Traveler publicized the full story in a five-part series. Since the somewhat 
inaccurate newspaper account was written without the Hills' consent or cooperation, the couple decided to approach author John G. Fuller, who was in New England at the time investigating sightings for his 
book Incident at Exeter. He was given full access to the details of their story, resulting in the October 1966 publication of The Interrupted journey. In the early 1970s Marjorie Fish, an Ohio schoolteacher, com-
pleted a prodigious six-year search to find a match for the stars in Betty Hill's star map. By constructing models of the Sun's stellar neighborhood, Fish believed she had identified all of the linked stars shown 
in the drawing, including the home base of the aliens (Zeta Reticuli) and our own sun.",sqhwpp,27,,1644637087.0,5,0.88

244,aliens,"Why are we assuming that ETs are, as a matter of course, more ""advanced"" than humans?","The more I read literature on abductee accounts -- which I think is the most important data we have regarding UFO/ET phenomena --, the less convinced I am that the ETs we've been in contact with during this century and the last unambiguously represent some inconceivable and totalized level of development. In fact, I would venture to say that what we know about at least the Grays is uninspiring.

In a sense, I think that this popular conclusion -- that Earth-visiting ETs *must* be way beyond us in every respect -- rests on the same fallacious sort of thinking which has led us to categorize this or that society as *First World* or *Third World*: categorizations which explicitly favor a level of industrial and capitalistic infrastructure. This is one of our tacit ideologies in the modern world, and it informs things down to the level of what counts as ""development"" in a videogame series like SimCity, where the most ""advanced"" city has been predetermined according to the logic of industrialism.

Put another way, it's really easy to look at what appears to be the technological cunning and efficiency of UFOs and presume that this alone represents human-exceeding intelligence. But I think that it, instead, represent a *facet* of intelligence which is object-oriented and computationally brilliant. We seem to often forget, in these discussions, that intelligence can also encompass aspects such as emotionality, rhetoric, artistry, humor, and so on. It is in these aspects that I detect a noticeable deficiency in ETs, who seem to be sexually inefficient, emotionally dim, and non-individuated.

If we're going to be serious about speculations concerning the possible motives of ETs, we should be equally serious about respecting how advanced we are in our own right, regardless of whether or not we believe we were genetically tampered with, and regardless of how much ecological ruination has inspired misanthropy. To me, the possibility that some beings may have figured out a way to bypass light-speed limitations is just not *quite* as impressive if those same beings are constitutionally incapable of writing music, singing aloud, or telling a hilarious joke. So, I don't know about you, but, from my vantage point, the ET existence looks sad -- cold, clinical, and with little to offer besides powerful emotional and mental manipulation.

Well, then. There's my anti-ET prejudice.",sqhhpl,4,,1644635734.0,21,0.64
245,aliens,Xetas/Zetas In Australia,"So, if you've ever wondered where ETs would be living on Earth, you'd probably want to live somewhere fairly remote.

Some say that aliens communicate telepathically. Is this the only form of communication that you know off? If so, some say they are already among us and blend in perfectly you wouldn’t realise it. Then they should be able to speak our languages perfectly, not? Or do they only have communication with the ones that are in black projects?

The other thing I read a lot is that we human beings are not ready to know the truth of extraterrestrial life in the universe. If so, why is that? We could say there is life beyond what we know, they evolved much better than we already have (something very uncommon) so what is there more shocking to know? Is there a real “Star Wars” going to happen and are we all just gonna get smoked out by some over powered alien squad?

Not all extraterrestrial life got to the point of space travelling, are there any species that can go further than others? Do they all have stars they can’t go to because the universe is just infinitely?

In AATIP slide number 9 there is a reference to the “phenomena” using “cognitive human interface”. When Lue Elizondo was asked about it he responded that this was basically CE5 (Close Encounters of the 5th kind or Human Initiated Contact with extra terrestrial or non human intelligence). 

There are some golden quotes here:

Garry Nolan: “we’re not the top predator, we are not at the top of the food chain”

Jacques Vallee: “there was a controlled landing by a very interesting craft that was taken away by the army in the white sands area where there was nuclear testing”

Grant Cameron: “they are benevolent and trying to help us and move us along”. …. “They are in charge, they are the ones running the show”

The host of the show, James Iandoli has done interviews with some of the best experts in this field and his channel barely gets any attention. He is also one of the leaders of the CE5 Facebook groups which anyone who is interested can join. There are CE5 groups in many areas and it is a great way to have your own experience/ proof. On top of that, it is 100% free, don’t even consider paying anyone (looking at you Dr Greer) for something that is fun and free. Alternatively just do some CE5 with some friends or family who are keen to see something. Anyone who does CE5 will confirm that the phenomena seems keen to wave to us and let us know it is there.

However, with two hours of missing time, the witnesses later recalled much more in separate hypnotic regression sessions.","*Name/Date/Location:* ""Susan,"" 42, ""Jennifer,"" 49; November 7, 1989; Near Goodland, Kansas


*Preliminary:* Driving home to St. Louis from Aspen, Colorado, saw bright light in sky ahead at 11:40 P.M. 


*Initial activities:* After pacing car for a while, an object descended just ahead to within 100 ft. (30m), hovered over a field. After they stopped the car to investigate, a cone of multicolor light began shining down onto the ground from the craft. Next memory was of driving away feeling exhausted and irritable. They stopped at a motel at 2:30 A.M., one with flushed face, the other very pale. Next morning they discovered nearly two-hour ""missing time"" period. 


*Craft/Beings:* Under hypnosis on November 24, they recalled the car being floated into a disc-shaped craft where they were examined by 5.5-ft. (1. 7 m) slender beings with large heads, huge slanted dark eyes, pointed chins, white skin, tiny nose, vestigial mouth, and four long fingers on each hand. 


*Onboard features:* Circular room with windows and panels, diffuse pink-white lighting, narrow examination table, ""hieroglyphics"" on a wall, computer-like panels with blinking lights; a long corridor, an ""auditorium"" with seats, a floating platform with a railing.

 
*Onboard activities:* Examination under bright light, instrument like dental pick used to place something in ""Jennifer's"" nose, preoccupation with fingers and hands (electrodes/wires attached). 


*Communication:* ""Susan"" received telepathic messages about ""genetic coding,"" ""mutual advancement of both races,"" and a ""telepathic link"" with earthlings. ""Jennifer"" recalled no clear messages, but vague impressions of their purpose being related to ""body chemistry.""

 
*Termination/Return:* Both recall returning to the original room, floating back down to their car escorted by two beings, and some kind of gesture that induced amnesia. 


*Aftermath:* ""Susan"" experienced anxiety, restlessness, and exhaustion, later job and lifestyle changes. She felt it was a positive, mind-expanding, growth experience. ""Jennifer"" had severe nosebleeds, insomnia, flushed face, later content and functioning well, pursuing some new interests.

So if Aliens are UAPs/UFOs. Then that means they can have the technology to travel light-years to Earth. And basically can control time and space with their tech. Their tech is basically magical or too advanced/complex at this point. So superpowers like Telekinesis and Telepathy don't seem that far-fetched once you think about the tech. 🤔

258,aliens,"It’s not much, but I saw a ufo today","I was out at my aunt’s property with her and my Nan. We had been there since sunset and we’re watching the stars. This place is like four hours from our nearest major city so light pollution is low as, though the moon was pretty bright tonight.

I had been taking long exposure photos of the stars on my phone. Got a few good ones too. I sit back down with them, and we’re all looking at the stars. My aunt has been pointing out all the satellites you can see - they look like stars both in brightness and the distance away your eyes can discern,  but just move in a predictable trajectory.

Suddenly, she points out this really bright satellite that, weirdly enough, seems much closer. You know how you just tell how far away something is? Well yeah this one was self evidently much closer than you would expect a satellite to be. You can’t know for sure but I reckon within a couple hundred metres max. It too is also moving in a direction, so it mustn’t be a star. But the longer I look at this thing the more I notice about it that makes me think it’s not a satellite.

It’s wobbling!! It’s not steady in the way it’s moving, it’s kinda bobbing back and forth, side to side as it moves in this set direction. Immediately I know what it is. I’ve only been thinking about aliens seriously past couple months but yeah I already reckoned they were here doing their own thing… as they do.

I point out its weird movements to both them and they agree it’s very weird, unlike anything they’ve seen, and can’t be a satellite. I then pull out the ‘I think it’s a ufo’ but I don’t think they gave it a second thought, they were more distracted by this strange bobbing moving light in the sky. So I’m a bit more persistent in that I think it’s a ufo and eventually I get my Aunty interested enough to have a conversation about that absurd idea that I genuinely believe it to be an extraterrestrial vehicle.

Turns out she doesn’t think it’s that absurd and likes the way I think about it. She says believes that Roswell was a legitimate alien crash, and that gives me enough confidence to pull up that Bob Lazar clip on this subreddit that explains how the craft fly, and why at low speeds they look goofy - they bob back and forth cause they continually pulling themselves with their gravity generators or whatever. And yeah, this thing was moving at pretty a slow speed - we we’re watching it for about a minute, minute and a half - and is behaving exactly as predicted.

In the end I don’t get a definitive “yeah I agree” but it seemed to be they weren’t able to internalise any better explanation for this uniquely intense light with unexplainable movement and proximity, and at least liked the idea that it was extraterrestrial.

But also! To see it with your own two eyes EXACTLY matching the explanation Bob gave as to how they fly is absolutely fascinating. Nice to know I’m not crazy for this left-field belief. And it gives a shit tonne more credibility to Bob Lazar for me now.

Also that I was in close enough proximity to an extraterrestrial (or at least extraterrestrial tech) to recognise it. So cool.

Footage  by Skinwalker Ranch in 2013. You can hear more interactions here along  with in the bush strangeness. You can hear the follow-through of info  from the electronic to the natural realm. I also recount what got me  into ufology from a ufo encounter in Nelson, Nevada in 2013 (with  original footage from that day). (Its taken me a bit to put this  together.) Also a snippet of an interview I did with a DOC worker who  saw two Bigfoot Moehau’s on the job!

Also  most strange is the communications from these anomalous beings who hide  in the wild while yelling out to me. Who call my name and taking me!

265,aliens,How to contact aliens,"I'm not sure if everyone is familiar with the Dark Forest idea from the Three-Body Problem. Essentially the idea is that the reason appears so silent isn't because nothing is there, but it's hiding. And anything that makes a sound gets eaten by something more powerful.


I like this idea but it's obviously very unsettling if you're excited about imaging a universe where humanity cooperates with and embraces aliens. It makes our current strategy as being needlessly loud and risky. It also makes the idea of ever building a Dyson Sphere seem pretty dumb.


Personally, I don't know if first contact as already been made or not. I think my following plan works in either case. The idea is that we have to bootstrap a communication channel in a way that doesn't risk the safety and security of Earth. 


The actual 3 body problem could provide us the solution. A dark object flying through space and swinging around multiple stars could have an orbit designed so anyone who finds the object (after enough time) has no idea where it came from. 

I suggest we send some sort of firework to explode 10 or so lightyears above the galatic center. Anyone who saw this firework would now know that fellow intelligent life exists and is open to making contact.

With this line of thinking, I think we should use our telescopes to search for such explosions over interesting geometrical points in space like above the center of a galaxy or maybe in the center of a cluster of galaxies. If we can find such a heat signature, we could once and for all prove the existence of fellow intelligent life.

I think it'd be a wonderful message to send as it presents humanity to the universe as a mature and intelligent civilization. One open to contact but aware of the dangers. If we just keep randomly and chaotically expanding into space, we present ourselves as either stupid or as a virus. I don't think the universe wants a stupid virus to spread.

We should be very careful in the details of our first signal not to date our technology or give away too much information about ourselves.

If first contact has already been made, then I think it's still a good thing to do as it may be what the aliens are waiting for to know Earth is ready. In any case, it's an expensive & long sighted mission with the beautiful goal of connecting the universe. 


I'm curious what you all think.

I mean how can you be interested in the subject and not believe the guy. he’s like one of the founding fathers of the UFO movement. 

• It’s because of Bob that we know about the existence of Area 51

• Bob described the vehicles EXACTLY how they are described today - both by civilians, military personnel and government officials. this is the most uncanny aspect imo. 

• Bob’s story hasn’t changed in 30+ years AND has completely stood the test of time. He has never been debunked. Never. 

•If he was lying, why would the government attempt to scrub his academic records and scientific expertise? 

• Also, if he was lying, why is he constantly being harassed, literally every day. you don’t do that to someone who is “obviously” lying, right? No, you do that to someone who has completely challenged your worldview. he doesn’t go about trying to prove his story charging $100 a ticket. he literally told his story, said you don’t have to believe me and thats it.

*Preliminary:* Driving from North Dakota to Louisiana, in late afternoon the Salters experienced total amnesia for about 60 miles (100 km). They took an unusual route through a remote area without knowing why, and experienced ""missing time."" The next morning along the highway they briefly sighted a disclike object that approached their truck, then sped away. Dreams and flashbacks in the ensuing months began to reveal a partially repressed UFO encounter that began to emerge in detail in late June. 


*Initial activities:* At dusk the pickup truck was forced off the highway onto a rough, winding road and the Salters stopped and got out. Some beings appeared, two or three of whom climbed up on the back 
bumper, and examined the gear in the back of the truck. The Salters were taken to a landed craft in a secluded clearing. 


*Craft/Beings:* About 6 or 7 beings 4-4.5 ft. (1.2-1.4 m) tall, with thin bodies and limbs, comparatively large heads, very large slanted eyes, and one taller, more human-like being, close to 6ft. (1.8 m) tall, not as proportionately thin. All are wearing tight fitting light colored outfits. Three of the small humanoids gather around the witnesses watching them in apparent fascination. Both witnesses recall following the humanoids to where a disc shaped craft rested.


*Onboard features:* Brightly lighted room, a blue glowing panel, instruments. 


*Onboard activities:* Implant placed in John Jr.'s nose, injections in neck and upper chest. John III's face closely scanned by a lighted device, with special attention to the jaw area. 


*Communication:* Telepathic. 


*Termination/Return:* They walked back to the truck, John Jr. accompanied by the taller being, who was carrying some kind of a light. He indicated he would come back. As they sat in the truck they saw the craft rise diagonally up into the dark clouds and disappear. 


*Aftermath:* John Jr. gave up smoking (breaking a 30-year, four pack a day habit and a 20-year pound of pipe tobacco a week habit), noted faster healing of cuts and faster growth of hair and nails, improved circulation, better skin tone, heightened immunity to flu and colds, increased energy level. He and John Ill view their experience as totally positive and the aliens as benign and caring. Information about earlier encounters has slowly emerged.

272,aliens,The skies are alive,"
https://youtu.be/kifFFlb1ym8

There is an overwhelming abundance of evidence that the “phenomena” as it is called by Jacques Vallee, Lue Elizondo and many others communicates with humans, or makes itself known to humans with bizarre orb and plasmoid sky phenomena. Some researchers have spent more than a decade of their life trying to get more information about this phenomena. Things like “Ebani” or sky snakes have most probably been seen throughout all of our time on this planet. They would account for stores of dragons, rainbow serpents and Quetzalcoutl as they appear like shining multicoloured sky snakes (some videos and a documentary below.

Another user - u/Soggy-Investigator53 made an excellent post about hard scientific investigations and speculation about this phenomena. Here is the link:

https://www.reddit.com/r/HighStrangeness/comments/sml79z/this_is_what_we_are_probably_getting_as_a/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf

All signs point to intelligence and communication between species. Some have speculated that this entity/ force manifests in a polymorphism and camouflage behaviour much like an octopus:

https://youtu.be/q8xJ13pAZNw

I have personally observed orbs and plasmoid anomalies on many occasions. I have filmed them and friends and family have seen them. They display certain bizarre but consistent behaviours:

1. They are responsive. They seem to appear when you want them to appear. There are many CE5 groups who all observe this behaviour 
2. They seem to be able to shift from energy to a plasmoid/ shiny ballon entity and back gain. They also change form, color and emit points of light
3. They seem to develop an attachment. Once you start to see them, the frequency and flamboyance seems to increase. You see them more often, at all hours of the day and night. 

So here is a bunch of cool videos and channels you can sink your teeth into. Hope you enjoy. It definitely changes our idea that sky phenomena is aliens in metallic ships, seems to mw that the vast majority of sky phenomena is an indigenous energy/ light/ plasma life forms or that some higher entity manifests in this way.

274,aliens,Time Dilation,"Excuse the informality, but I just had a thought come across my mind.

So many people ask the question of why aliens don’t make themselves known. Land on the White House lawn and be done with it.

Could time dilation at fractions, the speed of, or super luminal travel be the cause of some sort of time dilating barrier?

Time dilation under immense acceleration would cause a leap forward in time for anyone not traveling at that speed. At the speed of light, you would experience the future in fractions of a second. Superluminal travel, while according to known physics is not possible because of a deficit of required infinite energy source needed, would more than likely exponentially distort space time to a greater degree. 

If aliens decided to travel in this manner, they would travel far distances in mere moments, but at the expense of the time relative to all spacetime around them. Meaning they wouldn’t arrive at their destination for millennia, if sufficiently far away.

Even if they’d decided to come, it’s possible they’re just on their way, and won’t arrive for a very, very long time. Even if it only seems like a short time for them.

I’m sure I’m not the first person to think of this, I just haven’t seen this question or one like it talked about on this subreddit since I’ve joined. I enjoy these types of physics based conversations in relativity to the idea of aliens.",souny8,8,,1644459069.0,18,0.75
275,aliens,"The more I look at the evidence, the more incredulous I become.","I used to believe we have been visited, or are currently being visited by extraterrestrial life. In recent years, I have become more and difficult to convince of their existence. Does alien life exist out there somewhere? Maybe, but I'm having a hard time now believing that they are, or have been, here. 

Science is a system that runs on scrutiny. You make an observation. You come up with a hypothesis. If the hypothesis can withstand substantial scrutiny, it becomes a theory. And then when a theory can withstand substantial scrutiny, it becomes a law. But even then, established understandings of the universe are not free from being reexamined. We found that Newton did not stand up when dealing with extreme gravity like that of black holes. So we have an extension of our understanding of gravity with Einstein's special relativity, and the universe makes more sense because of it. This isn't science failing, it's just doing what it's supposed to. 

This is no small thing. Why then do we listen to evidence that is wholly anecdotal? Ok, you have black and white footage of a a weird object captured by military craft. If you cannot identify it, then what could it possibly be used as evidence for? And who cares who makes the claim? I don't care if Steven Hawking (RIP) had come out and said *""Yes, aliens are totally among us right now. Just trust me. I mean I'm literally Steven hawking.""* It wouldn't matter. Either they are, or they are not. It doesn't matter who says what about them. So eye witness accounts mean nothing when you have a claim as bold as extraterrestrial beings walking among us. Hard evidence is needed. Evidence that others can observe. Much lesser things have been put under much heavier scrutiny. 

I am not saying it is impossible. I am keeping the door to believing propped open. I remain merely exceedingly skeptical, until I see undeniable evidence.",sou963,0,,1644457982.0,25,0.42

- The sapient aliens who have visited Earth are not hostile, they are explorers. Their only designs on Earth are cataloguing our taxonomy for the joy of knowledge.

- They arrived in the 1940s. All previous claims of alien visitation are, to your knowledge, fictional.

- They do not look like Greys, instead loosely resembling a six-limbed pangolin with an insectoid face that is unsettling to look at unless you’re used to them.

- They are unwilling to share their technology wholesale, because past experience has taught them that technological and social uplifting does not work, and only leads to devastation.

- The intelligence agencies of the Soviet Union and United States made a mutual agreement to hide the existence of aliens for fear that the paradigm shift could destabilise the cold war and spark armageddon.

278,aliens,"Geo-Spatial Intelligence (the Study of Things Moving on Earth) Might Become the Future ""Right Hand"" of Ufology, and the Agencies in Latin America studying The Phenomenon Want In.","This is an extremely simplified explanation of this career: [NGA Explains: What is Geospatial Intelligence?] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8keqUuxT6Y&ab_channel=NationalGeospatial-IntelligenceAgency)

I found about this area of Global Sciences yesterday while thinking about cutting a sphere in triangles and measuring its angles before and after, and realizing just how much skewed the real layout of Earth is compared to our limited perception of it. 

So I started searching and found about Geo-Spatial Intelligence: The study of Earth and objects moving on the surface of Earth, from and Satellital Point of View.

But in that very same video (which is the first video YouTube will show you if you search for ""Geo-Spatial Intelligence"" in English) you will find the reason why this is not very spread field of study, that last two sentences 

> [...that knowledge allows the Unites States leaders to know what's happening on the Earth and make decisions about solid Geo-Spatial Intelligence. And as the old saying goes ""Knowledge is Half the Battle"".] 

has a kinda belic undertone that made me think the US don't want ""undesired nations"" to have experts in Geo-Spatial Intelligence. 

The problem is that Disarmed ""3rd world"" Countries like mine could use such knowledge (and the measuring tech of course, like high-end cameras) for not-belic purposes, like Weather Forecast, Ecology and Environmentalism and the efficient management of our satellites (mind you, Argentina is the only Latin American country with satellites). 

Here is more information: 

- [Official GOV Page about Geo-Spatial Rights (Oct 2021)] (https://enaun.cancilleria.gob.ar/en/content/general-debate-peaceful-uses-outer-space-23rd-october) 

- [English written analyze of our ARSAT Satellites] (https://www.derechoespacial.org/2015/11/arsat-2-argentina-consolidates-as-latin-american-satellite-leader/)

Why am I posting this here? Well Argentina and Chile are putting together and effort to study (and maybe even attempt to contact) UFOs. Yes, you heard that right. The Andes and Patagonia were, are and will always be hotspots for The Phenomenon and now the governments and armed forces are disclosing documents and proposing Ufology as a worthy area of study. 

I want attention, not for me of course Im just your average tinfoiled reddit dweller, but **Attention to my Country and the Continent its In** because we are mostly Peaceful Open-Minded people. Our countries are Interested in Sustainable Energy and Technologies. We are struggling, yes, but if having free healthcare and free college education is the reason of our economical struggles then I think is worth it. 


We are a Nuclear-Disarmed Continent. Another of our neighbors: Paraguay reached 100% sustainability last year. Bolivia wants to mine lithium without super powers bullying them for cheap labor, so they can develop state of the art battery technology and supply global demand. 

And Im posting this because maybe an expert in Geo-Spatial Intelligence who is searching for a place to settle down, might want to pioneer Latin America's Ufology studies, Ive read all about our current experts and we really need that help. 

Anyways, the **TL;DR** is: 

- Geo-Spatial Intelligence is the study of Things Moving on Earth, and it shouldn't be considered a belic (war-oriented) field of study just because of its nature. 

- There are coalitions for the study of The Phenomenon Internationally. One is ICER and they are working with Latin-American Institutions like CEFORA (Argentine Ufology Institutions) and similar Institutions from Chile and Brazil, and we could use this field of study to spot, analyze and hopefully comprehend some UAP Sightings. 

- This is One of the examples of Official Military Investigations Disclosed to the Public by the Chilean Government: [Armada Chilena Confirma Avistamiento de un OVNI (2014)] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjSQBQahKCc&ab_channel=AGENCIAEFE)

*Preliminary:* Walking home about 3:00A.M., ""Thomas"" noticed that all sounds of nature had ceased and he heard an unexplained faint humming sound that seemed to be coming from a field. He left his path to investigate and the sound became louder. Then he saw a dully 
glowing dark shape hovering just off the ground, obscuring the starlight. Some beings approached. 


*Initial activities:* ""Thomas"" was seized by the arm and apparently floated to the craft, where he found himself in a large bare room. 


*Craft/Beings:* The craft was domed and disc-shaped, about 25 ft. (7.5 m) in diameter, with antenna-like protrusions, a hatchway, and windows at the top. A group of humanoids approached from across the 
field, and when he turned to flee another being blocked his path. They were wearing what looked like octagonal helmets. Two dim lights were positioned where their eyes should be. Their clothing was gray with gold-colored belts and straps like suspenders, black knee boots and gloves. Their arms and legs moved in a rapid, stilted manner reminding him of robots. 


*Onboard features:* From the large room ""Thomas"" was taken to a control room with TV consoles and a large screen on the wall. 


*Onboard activities:* The craft apparently took off, and ""Thomas"" observed planets passing by on the large screen. Beyond Pluto the craft docked with a ""mother ship."" On board the larger craft he was examined on a table. One of the beings probed him with a long instrument that was pointed on the end, and he thought it was responsible for ""burn marks"" on his body next day. Probes were placed on his head, chest, and around his neck. He thought that his heart rate was manipulated by the beings. A music tape cassette was removed from his pocket and apparently analyzed in a console; he heard them play the heavy rock music. 


*Communication:* The beings communicated directly into his head 
(telepathy). He was told that they came from a planet beyond the constellation of Lyra, that they breathed pure oxygen and disliked the polluted atmosphere of the earth. They had a temporary base in Greenland and had been forced to destroy bases on the moon to avoid discovery by space probes and astronauts. He was told that they had captured a Voyager spacecraft for study and found it to be ""very primitive."" The beings told him they would seek him out again in the future. 


*Termination/Return:* At some point ""Thomas"" became aware that he was being taken back to earth. He suddenly found himself back in the field in North Wales, his last recollection being of the craft disappearing from view in the night sky. 


*Aftermath:* He felt dizzy and experienced a sensation of floating. A policeman spotted him staggering around and questioned him. Satisfied that ""Thomas"" was not drunk or on drugs, the officer took him home, arriving at 5:30 a.m. There ""Thomas"" suddenly felt frightened and 
was in a state of shock. The next day he found burn marks on his body. He continued to have nightmares and underwent hypnotherapy, after which he preferred not to talk about the experience.

289,aliens,Theory: Earth is NOT an Ant Farm OR Cosmic Zoo,"EDIT: Read the comments, I explain more.

Consider this: Earth is NOT an ant farm OR a cosmic zoo. It's a bioengineering laboratory.

If we had the capability to create other sentient beings, we'd immediately outlaw it, same as we did for cloning. It stands to reason that other species might behave similarly. But, that doesn't mean ALL of them would abide the law, same as us.

It is generally believed by Earth scientists our star system is surrounded by the ""Oort Cloud"", a hypothetical (only because we haven't physically SEEN the objects there) sphere of 10*12 objects like comets n such. That's quite a lot of material to block our tiny star's output from an outside perspective. Couple that with the theory that life is more likely to spring up CLOSER to the center of the galaxy where there is vastly more energy to consume and the fact that our system is on the backwater edge of the Orion Arm and it stands to reason we might actually be very difficult to spot in the skies of other worlds excepting by our transmissions which are still hundreds to tens of thousands of years away from reaching them. That makes right here a prime location to conduct illegal experiments without being noticed by anyone outside the system.

Could also be the answer to why there is a ridiculous level of diversity on this planet, even within the species themselves. And who would want their illegally made sentient beings to advance enough to get to the stellar level? Not the makers, they'll be busted and suffer whatever punishments there may be for such crimes in their society. It's a loss if that happens so they misinform us, keep us divided, and continually ""stir the pot"" down here to prevent us from unifying because only through unification can we advance further than the current stage.

Could also explain the multiple alien races if we consider that at least some of our makers were already caught. Perhaps THAT is the reason ""Gods"" no longer walk among us openly. Our makers didn't fear to back when, we are harmless to them, but their captors might adopt a ""well they're sentient so we have to let them evolve naturally"" kind of tone and keep themselves hidden. Makers still at large would also keep themselves hidden as to avoid detection by their captors.

But imagine as the benevolent captors you watch this species evolve RAPIDLY and get to a point where they have the capability to join you but are utterly wrecking their perfect world (which may be a rarity) faster than they're going to get to you. You'd want to help them but you cannot do it directly, so you find other ways; appearing in the sky, telepathic communication, influencing the influencers, etc. Your enemies adopt the same practices; hence Earth's legends of gods and mythical creatures that suspiciously are all similar to one another despite these cultures having no contact.

Kinda makes a little too much sense to me, especially when reading ancient mythologies. The Sumerians, Hindus, and Abrahamic religions (and I'm sure others) speak of wars between the gods. To me it's almost like The Seven Tablets and Mahabharata are from the perspective of the ""gods"" and The Torah, The Bible, and The Quran are from the perspective of Earth humans. The Egyptian and Greek mythologies also tell similar/identical stories and the mythologies of the Americas seem to line up to key parts in the stories from across the world such as when ""gods"" were banished in Mesopotamia and arrive in the Americas to start a new civilization.

290,aliens,This 1983 event includes a large number of humanoids in a massive craft hundreds of feet long and seven stories tall. It is unclear whether an abduction took place:,"*Name/Date/Location:* ""Pat Norris,"" 28; February 3, 1983; Mobile, Alabama


*Preliminary:* Driving home in the evening ""Norris"" heard explosion, and her car began to vibrate and shake, making it difficult to steer. After the vibrating stopped she turned onto another road and saw that the woods ahead were brilliantly illuminated. At first she thought that there was a helicopter search in progress until she saw a huge object about half a mile west of her. The brightly lighted object that gave off a high-pitched sound. 


*Craft/Beings:* The craft was seven to eight stories (70 to 80 feet) high and “six telephone poles” (210 feet) wide—and appeared to be moving toward her at four or five miles per hour. She noted a “chopping wind, a high-pitched sound, and a roaring sound” as well as the vibration. She noted the “whipping of the wind—like a tornado.” The craft was discoidal on the front but elongated on the side. http://imgur.com/gallery/wjaVJFr

When the object reached a point fairly close to Mrs. Norris, it halted and all of the noise stopped. It was completely silent, and Mrs. Norris lost all the fear she had felt before. She then got out of the car to get a better look. She strained to take in every detail—feeling like a child with “unbelievable happiness.”

As the craft appeared, Mrs. Norris’s attention was drawn to a top deck with a long window she estimated to be fifty-three feet and through which she viewed twenty or thirty persons, apparently oblivious of her presence, walking about as if they were changing shifts. The wall behind them was curved and white. 

*Onboard features:* Through a window in an upper deck she saw 20-30 beings, slender humanoids with large chests, about 5 ft. 10 in. (1.7+ m) tall, pale-skinned, large heads, no hair, and small ears. They wore one-piece white suits. 


*Possible Onboard activities:* After the event, in repeating vivid ""dreams,"" she saw many lights, a gold and silver tree, a circular table, metal rods used as instruments. She lay on a table with the beings surrounding her. One being was very old. At one point when she felt cold, one of the beings held a hand over her body and she felt warmth. She changed her position on the table to accommodate them as they touched metal rods to various parts of her body. The beings relieved pressure she felt in her head and her lifelong back problems. 


*Communication:* While she was on the table the beings communicated with her by telepathy. They questioned her about her physical and emotional feelings.

If our DNA, is such that it encodes the organism on how to grow, would it not stand to reason that, given 2,000 years of advancement, humans could potentially learn how to grow products instead of machining them?

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFGMdp4fRog](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFGMdp4fRog)

This really made me think, as I have been hearing much about how UAP interactions often lead to not only alien visitations, but of orbs, poltergeist activity, ghosts etc.

I am wondering if this indicates that the presence of these craft / beings can lead to a ""tear in reality"", or a weakening of the boundary between our universe and another? This ""other"" is a reality where all the above mentioned players reside in, but certain locations, activities or earlier presence provides for some gateway to remain open, allowing them to interact in our dimension.",snhj41,16,,1644317966.0,7,0.78
293,aliens,Trans-dimensional beings? Really?,"Many of us are the hard-science types: show me the evidence. 

Now that the informational leaf-petals of ""disclosure"" are unfolding - most notably with the Pentagon affirming the authenticity of the UAP videos shot by military pilots - those of us interested in the subject are hearing a lot about ""trans-dimensional beings"" and that the ""aliens"" won't be what we expect.

We've been seeded with information that they may not be corporeal or wholly physical. We've been teased that their method of communication may not directly correlate with ours - hinting that we'll get impressions, feelings, pictures or some direct-to-mind contact if and when we get contact. 

Yet there seem to be physical craft - countless thousands of which have been claimed to be seen (and some documented well) - so why would they need those if they don't have physical bodies? The record seems to show many varieties and types of craft based upon human observations and accounts. There have been reports of physical beings appearing, abducting humans, and so on. 

So are there two or more species of aliens visiting? Are we an animal park along the space highway? Are we that giant ball of yarn off the main highway in the middle of nowhere - a curiosity to see?

Let's take a side-trip to Skinwalker Ranch: much is made of the ""negative forces"" and decades of accounts of shadowy figures, wolf-like creatures, glowing orbs, etc. Some reports say these phenomena followed home some of the people who worked at the site. What if the area is the equivalent of a nuclear waste dump and these negative apparitions are merely a 'Keep Out' warning? If there are some kind of ""portals"" or unknown-to-us energy fields at work at Skinwalker Ranch perhaps it's something simple, a dump-site for alien tech that went bad. 

The ""negative"" or ""dark"" feelings evoked by the phenomena at that site could be nothing more than that's the frequency upon which such tech operates - and the field resonates in such a way as to trigger the human amygdala (the human brain's fear center) and scary apparitions are similar to what people perceive when they have sleep paralysis and night terrors. 

Regardless of what any alien species might be interested in with regards to Earth and we humans the fact is they want something or they wouldn't come here. First and foremost if there is disclosure and following that some acknowledged relationship secret parts of various governments have with aliens from outside of Earth (even if they are ""trans-dimensional"") surely they can answer that one question of *Why come here?*",snb21o,21,,1644294649.0,32,0.69

297,aliens,So I Just Had A Theory...,"About the what and why of at least one of the extraterrestrial or intradimentional beings that interact with us. This all based on reoccurring concensus, reported experiences, or other popular theories. It may be a common theory that I just haven't read before, but I read this sub every day so I hope not.

In this theory, our DNA has been altered by other beings and probably some sort of other characteristics of ours. We indeed are just an experiment in a Zoo which often get brought up. There is some reason for this and it could be just boredom for all we know. The idea that we are all connected to each other in this world is also true. These beings are the reason we have a conscious and that voice in our head if they are not one in the same. The reason we have a conscious is due to them creating us and making that so. The reason that is there is because they gave us some of what they are made up of. (DNA, Spirit, Something we have clue about) So when we use our consciousness or that inner voice they feel/hear whatever is going on. So when abductees claim to have been talked to telepathically while being with the these beings that is not necessary just because that's how THEY communicate it's because we are part them. They are all connected by this and it's how they communicate and interact as a species, but it can also be used with us. When you hear amazing stories about people knowing someone was hurt by a feeling or an image of where they are pop in their head. They felt that burst of emotion and distress and are able to relay that to the other person.. The whole reason we exist in the way we exist is because they all are experiencing everything we are as a whole. The emotion, knowledge, most likely a laundry list of things they wouldn't be able to other wise. Possibly because they exist in the 4th Dimension and want to also experience the 3rd. More or less they want to experience everything. They probably have reached the peek of their existence and now find the dominant species of habitable planets and do to them the same as they have done to us. Imagine if we as a species got to the point where we could link ourselves to experience our pets. You don't think we do that? It's a lot and you will say I'm a nut, but just consider the idea if it already has been pitched like that before. I won't be able to debate, but have at it.

Also... All the technological advances (internet/social media/cell phones) they have had us make could be a test to see what would happen if they did indeed give us that full ""consciousness"" of communicating and feeling as one.. as they do with each other and with us.",sn69l4,2,,1644281286.0,6,0.6

Yet we see so many examples of, ""this alien told me this is true!"" Entire books of fantastical notions come out this way (Vallee lists this as yet another level of the control system in place to keep actual understanding away from humanity).

*Preliminary:* Police officer Godfrey on patrol at 5:05 A.M. saw a lighted object on the road ahead. He felt attracted to it, and felt alternately frightened and secure while he sat in the patrol car. 


*Initial activities:* Godfrey attempted to call the station on his radio, without success. Then he sketched the craft. Next moment he was 100 yards (90 m) down the road and the object was gone. He got out of the car and looked for the object. When he returned to the car it would not start. He then recalled a light beam striking him when he lost consciousness and floating and seeing an opening in the craft and being taken. 


*Craft/Beings:* Domed metallic disc with windows, luminous, additional lights on top and bottom. Central section spinning, bushes beneath it agitated. The beings on board included a human-looking man with thin nose, beard, and moustache, 6ft. (1.8 m) tall, wearing skullcap and sheet that gave him a Biblical appearance, and eight 3- to 3.5-ft. (0.9-1.0 m) metallic robots with 
headgear like lampshades, and a large black dog. 


*Onboard features:* Smiling and friendly man sitting at table, a bed, ceiling lights. 


*Onboard activities:* The robots touched him, and made beeping sounds. Godfrey thought of resisting, but instead lay down on the bed. A light from the ceiling shone down on him. The man communicated with him, touched his head, and he went into a trance. The robots removed his shoes and examined his toes; instruments placed on his arms and legs caused him pain and a feeling of sickness. There was a sickly smell, and he closed his eyes from time to time. 


*Communication:* When Godfrey got out of his car a voice told him he should not see the object. On board, the man told him telepathically that the overhead light was not for his eyes.

“Let’s now speak about what being apparently a natural phenomenon shows very anomalous characteristics. As it will be discussed later, such anomaly might be related to the BLH hypothesis. Minerals contained in some rocky areas and mountains, especially near fault lines are sometimes able to indirectly produce “luminous plasma balls” of long duration at low height. This can be due to piezoelectric effects when rocks are under stress (especially if of seismic nature) or due to effects similar to a natural battery: both geophysical phenomena have also been simulated in a laboratory. The main physical causes producing anomalous light phenomena are today sufficiently well understood, but what we still do not know are the physical reasons why such light phenomena – often characterized by several colors and able to pulsate – show a long duration, i.e. which physics governs the plasma confinement mechanism. Another mystery is constituted by the fact that sometimes light balls are able to acquire a geometric shape. Several studies have been conducted by some researchers, including this author, in which it has been possible to build up a quite clear empirical and observational picture. Of course several physics theories have been proposed to try to explain the mechanism of long-lasting plasma confinement, but none of them resulted to be satisfactory so far. Before presenting a new hypothesis that seems to be quite a lot related with much of what has been discussed so far, we must make extensively two important premises: 1) the particles composing a plasma, which sometimes behaves as a quantum coherent medium, might resemble the behavior of the microtubules in the brain; 2) the behavior of plasma under particular conditions seems to simulate the human DNA. Let’s now discuss them.

Many years ago David Bohm’s first theoretical physics studies dealt with plasma. He discovered that plasma may behave as a highly cooperative structure, like if particles (ions and electrons) that are even very far away from each other are able to “feel” instantaneously what happens to one of them. This gives to plasma – at least qualitatively – a structure of coherence that is not dissimilar to the coherence found in quantum objects. Therefore the many particles composing plasma behave like if they were only one entity and not separated from each other, in such a way that any action done on a group of particles is just “felt” by another group of particles composing the same plasma agglomerate. At this point it is not so difficult, at least qualitatively, to find a strict similarity between plasma particles and the microtubules inside brain’s neurons. The previously amply discussed “OrchOr” Penrose-Hameroff theory about the brain states that microtubules and tubulins therein act like only one entity described by the same wave function. When – according to Penrose’s physics model – the wave function spontaneously collapses a moment of consciousness is generated, in such a way that an average human being is able to experience at least one million moments of consciousness daily. We have said that what we consider as consciousness can be strictly related to the idea that we have of “spirit”, in the ambit of a model (following also Bohm’s concepts about implicate and explicate orders) in which consciousness/spirit and its neural correlate (the brain) are strictly linked together in a way that the one cannot exist without the other.

Let’s now come to plasma. Can be the elementary particles constituting a plasma compared to microtubules in order that such particles, by composing a cooperative entity described by only one wave function, when working in unison all together can give rise to the emergence of consciousness? We are simply hypothesizing that some plasma balls might work at certain circumstances as a brain capable to produce moments of consciousness. But being a brain implies being a form of Life. Is it possible that a life form made of plasma exists? It seems so, according to some studies simulating its behavior.

Numerical simulations showed that when a plasma comes in contact with a cloud of fine dust grains, they immediately acquire an electric charge sucking electrons from the plasma surrounding them up to form a core of electrons which in turn attract the positively charged ions of the plasma itself, thus giving rise to those which have been called “plasma crystals”. Driven by electrostatic forces, dust grains are full twisting in helical structures, while the plasma becomes polarized. Plasma crystals acquire shapes that rapidly evolve into a double helix identical to that which characterizes the DNA, and which shows a self-organizing exceptional ability. This shape is replicated in other plasma crystals as if these forms could reproduce by sending a “genetic code” in everything surrounding them. The simulation shows that these helixes have two stable configurations represented by a small and a large spiral, while each helix contains various sequences of these two states. Researchers believe that such dynamic feature allows these structures to store information: the helix appears as a kind of informative code, which eventually leads to replicate through any structural transformation from a generation to another, and to give shape to increasingly complex and stable structures, a code at all comparable to the genetic information holding together the organic matter and with the characteristic of reproducing exactly as a living cell. In other words, it does seem that such structures made of dust and plasma is real living beings able to reproduce and evolve. If this is the case it is possible that a form of “plasma life” exists everywhere in the universe, from the interstellar space to our atmosphere. Transient light phenomena, whose plasma nature has been demonstrated in the course of instrumented observational research carried out in Hessdalen, Norway and in other similar places in the world, seem to trace quite closely the behavior of plasmas and dust recorded through numerical simulations, in form of balls of light that tend to divide, join, multiply, follow a spiral motion, resembling the behavior of a living cell. These balls of light contain substantially the same ingredients as simulated plasma crystals: plasma and the atmospheric dust in aerosol form, with water vapor as a possible catalyst generating thermo-electro-chemical processes able to confine these plasma spheres. Such anomalous light phenomena have a tendency to multiply and evolve, and do so on time scales of the order of minutes or even seconds. We want to test the hypothesis that such phenomena may acquire some level of elementary intelligence, which would be manifested through regular and/or semi-regular light pulsation. All this can be accurately measured using high-speed photometry by acquiring 10.000 frames per second and then analyzed using time-series analysis.

In few words, from what has been extensively discussed above, it might be possible to hypothesize that if really plasmas too are able to become in certain conditions real Life forms, then a part of them might evolve towards forms of intelligence that is more or less sophisticated. The consequences of such an hypothesis would be really disruptive, because then for any life form (even intelligent) based on plasma a planetary atmosphere would be an almost irrelevant prerequisite to make them live, as there should be no need of a “habitability zone” for as we have conceived it until now in the ambit of canonical projects such as, in particular, the SETI Project. According to this scenario Life forms based on plasma might truly live everywhere in the Universe. If this were effectively the case all the planets of the solar system – even those with the most poisonous atmospheres – might indifferently harbor life forms of this kind. As it happens on the Earth the trigger – we could denominate it as a “midwife” – for the birth of such plasma forms starts from natural mechanisms due to the geophysical conditions of the soil or underground, to atmospheric mechanisms or to both. Due to different causes, the interstellar space is everywhere full of plasma, at various temperatures, and this might furnish the incubator for the birth and the development of Life forms that might be also characterized by intelligence, without any constraint with the biological conditions of livability as we have understood it so far. It is even obvious that if intelligence were able to develop inside such hypothetical plasma structures, then some form of science and technology might spring from it, in a form that is totally different from how we, sentient biochemical beings based on carbon chemistry, are able to understand it. In fact intelligence, by its nature, is lead to build up organized, coherent and ordered structures. Moreover, according to this hypothesis, we cannot exclude at all that such intelligences may be able to organize in form of true neural networks for the exchange of information, which might occur also using the mechanism of quantum entanglement, which would permit the reception and the transmission of data that are not constrained by space and time.

Let’s now go back to the hypothesis that all plasma particles (or many of them) constituting such light balls are entangled together inside a quantum coherent structure similar to a human brain. In the brain a spontaneous collapse of the wave function describing the orchestrated complex of microtubules generates a moment of consciousness. Does this happen in plasma balls too? Before venturing an answer to this question let’s take into account what happens to such light balls when they are stimulated by some input of energy. Previous experiments carried out in Hessdalen and other places of the world too where the same kind of phenomenon is recurrent showed that aiming a Laser beam and/or a powerful flashlight at such luminous plasmoids triggers almost always a reaction from them. In some cases the plasma ball starts to pulsate or to change its pulsation rate every time in which the beam is directed towards them. This intriguing phenomenology didn’t occur seldom, but rather many times and it has been fully documented both by professional scientists and engineers and through many witness reports of normal persons. Of course, before thinking of some “intelligence” within the plasma we have to rule out the possibility that what happens is a kind of photon-photon interaction that we still do not know in physics. But we would be also tempted to suspect that the Laser and/or flashlight beam is able to make the wave function of plasma particles collapse, so that a consciousness moment is suddenly produced. Before that collapse, as in every quantum system, all the entangled plasma particles are in a condition of quantum superposition waiting to be awakened. It might happen that in the case of plasma balls they can become “conscious” only when they are stimulated by an external trigger. Laser and flashlight might not be the only working external triggers. Such triggers might come out spontaneously also from the natural electromagnetic field, magnetic anomalies or other geophysical and/or artificial causes.

In any fact it should be extremely interesting to verify how an electromagnetic trigger (not only in the optical range, but also in the microwave and VLF/ELF one) can be optimized by changing amplitude, frequency and even pulsation rate of the emitted beam, in order that a reaction from such light balls occurs. The detected phenomenon might be multiform in its reactions: possible “answers” from these plasmoids might change according to the way in which we tune the triggering beam of radiation. The feedback we expect to detect from light balls deals with changes of pulsation rate (and even rotation rate, deduced from Doppler Effect in optical spectra), color, dimension, shape or even with multiplication effects.

We cannot even exclude that light balls may contain inside a “message” ready to be awakened, previously coded within a program directed by a bigger quantum control coming just from the Big Library, in the same way in which some persons are connected non-locally with this kind of cosmic information. If the plasma constituting such luminous phenomena works substantially like a brain and if the BLH hypothesis is true, none can prevent us from suspecting that exactly the same mechanism occurring with living biological beings may be going on. We can even hypothesize that such light balls might be used as “sensors” to capture messages coming from … the infinite. In the same way in which, according to the NLSETI procedures, we are going to search for structured signals inside the noise of the human brainwave, in the specific case of such anomalous plasma phenomena we might analyze all the possible physical parameters (light intensity, color, frequency, dimensions, and pulsation rate, mainly) that we can measure using our scientific instruments in order to search for the same kind of signals.

Something very interesting might be found inside the data. We might also discover that after beaming a Laser beam at these lights the first time they might then start to take their own life in the sense that a new process, similar to the spontaneous wave function collapse in the brain microtubules, might keep them alive and maybe even conscious just like a new kind of Life form. This can be verified by carrying out observational measurements. Moreover, it is not so illogical to suggest that if such plasma balls are also able to increase in dimensions (this is often reported from pertinent casuistry) generating the effect of increasing the number of active particles, it might happen that, exactly like in the brain and according to the simple Penrose formula E = h / t , the number of consciousness moments increases as well until a human-like intelligence is reached or even more than that. This is obviously a hypothesis, certainly a bold one, but many factors when they are put all together induce us inevitably to ask certain questions. Does it really happen so? The only way to know this is just to make the appropriate verifications using measurement instruments.”",sml5rq,205,,1644222003.0,79,0.88

316,aliens,"CIA Codenames and Cryptonyms: Is ""MJ"" the missing bi-gram?","I found this description of how the CIA routed its documents on the [Mary Ferrell](https://www.maryferrell.org/pages/False_Names_in_CIA_Documents.html) website intriguing:

""*The first and most common mechanism of operational and personnel security has been to assign code names (cryptonyms) to functional sections of the CIA itself, to its offices and facilities, and to other government agencies as well as to its own operations and personnel. Cryptonyms are uppercased code names whose* ***first two letters*** (""**bi-gram**"")*provide a context and aid* ***document routing*** *- these two digits normally refer to the geographic or* ***functional area*** *of a particular directorate, geographic region, office, or* ***operation***. *As an example, the ""AE"" prefix was assigned to the Soviet Union. ""AM"" was used for Cuba, ""OD"" for the U.S. itself, and so on. Protocol called for the code names to be centralized and registered, but in practice, some groups - such as* ***counter-intelligence*** *- had the authority to create and control their own codes, and even* ***maintain their documents outside the centralized system during certain periods of time.***"" (my emphasis).

I've taken a snapshot of the webpage at [https://www.maryferrell.org/php/cryptdb.php?bigram=all](https://www.maryferrell.org/php/cryptdb.php?bigram=all) and **inserted** two additional bigrams - MI and MJ:

&#x200B;

[Modified CIA Bi-gram list as examplar](https://preview.redd.it/dybo1wkl1ag81.png?width=920&format=png&auto=webp&s=80e177f593cee47c740dfd56298ae697bc165d9d)

""MI"" would most likely not have been used to avoid confusion with British Intelligence's MI-5 and MI-6 organizations. The ""MJ"" bigram, however, may have been used to designate the **Special Investigations** **Group** of **Jim Angletons' Counterintelligence Division** and route all information and documents outside the regular CIA system, which Angleton was later found to have done by his successor, George Kalaris. CIA Assistant DDO Ted Shackley and Kalaris had to entice retired CIA officer Cleveland Cram to come back to work for them to ""*Find out what in hell happened. What were these guys doing*"". Kalaris thought Cram's study of Angleton's CI Division would be a one-year assignment. As David Wise points out in his book *Molehunt* (1992): ""*When Cram finally finished it in 1981... he had produced twelve legal-sized volumes, each three hundred to four hundred pages. Cram's approximately four-thousand-page study has never been declassified. It remains locked in the CIA's vaults.*""

[https://spartacus-educational.com/JFKcramC.htm](https://spartacus-educational.com/JFKcramC.htm)

Angletons' CI/SIG was heavily involved in monitoring Lee Harvey Oswald prior to the assassination. Curiously, they did not ""officially"" open a 201 file on him until a year AFTER his defection to the USSR, which is odd given the subject was a former U.S. Marine radar operator with a security clearance. The SIG has also had long been suspected of destroying documents related to LHO. Strangely, one of the Chiefs of another of Angleton's CI section, **Raymond G. Rocca**, wrote the narrative that CIA officers subpoenaed to the Warren Commission (including Director John McCone) would deliver under oath. Former CIA Director Allen Dulles, long rumored to be **MJ-1** and author of the ""**Burned Memo**"" assassination directive, was one of the members of the Warren Commission anyway so they had all bases covered in protecting the existence of the overall **MJ project regarding the alien presence.**

Another highly sensitive project was created around the same time as the peak of alien interaction (1952 Washington Flyover) with an ""**MK""** cryptonym was **MKUltra.** The existence of this project was only discovered due to a CIA ""accident"". In 1973, amid a government-wide panic caused by Watergate, CIA Director **Richard Helms** ordered all MKUltra files destroyed. Pursuant to this order, **most CIA documents regarding the project were destroyed,** making a full investigation of MKUltra impossible. A cache of some 20,000 documents survived Helms's purge, as they had been **incorrectly stored** in a financial records building and were discovered following a FOIA request in 1977. These documents were fully investigated during the Senate Hearings of 1977. Perhaps the **MJ compartment** documents were also ordered by Helms to be destroyed alongside the MK compartment documents, only surviving by being literally **""pulled from the fire""** of the classified document destruction furnace? Maybe the person who rescued these documents was source S1, and the surviving records were delivered as the ""**Majestic Documents**""?

Interestingly, the nickname ""**Majestic Jehovah**"" was supposedly given to the project bigram by Professor **Albert** **Einstein**, who, along with other leading scientists at the time, was briefed into the MJ compartment for their subject matter expertise. (I can't remember where I read this, I will try to locate the source).

Comments discussing the likelihood of the above theory (both for or against) are welcome.

*Preliminary:* While driving home from Denver at 11:45 P.M., a beam of blue light struck the car, loud whishing sound heard, car lights and radio failed, back wheels left pavement, and car rose into air at an angle. 


*Initial activities:* A being beckoned for them to enter arched doorway. ""Michael"" was floated inside. 


*Craft/Beings:* The car was lifted into a hovering domed craft and luminous entryway, and humanoid with large head, gray skin, very long and thin fingers, shiny golden garb with large collar. Strong ""electrical"" odor detected. Other beings on board, one of whom appeared to be a leader. 


*Onboard features:* Large room with control panels, luminous walls, arches edged by orange glow, table seemingly made of gases that solidified. 


*Onboard activities:* ""Michael"" had temporary feeling of peacefulness, but missed ""Mary"" and became angry. The beings used silver bands to restrain him. He sensed that one of the beings could read his thoughts. A light like an inverted bowl floated above ""Michael"" on the table, and melanoma spots on his legs seemed to burn. He heard ""Mary"" scream, turned and saw her naked like himself across the room with another being, her demeanor blank and zombie-like. He heard a rustling sound and felt as if his entire memory had been drawn out of his head. His memory returned shortly, but he sensed that the beings put in some thoughts that had not been there before, including knowledge that other dimensions exist. 


*Communication:* None recalled. 


*Termination/Return:* After the examinations ""Mary"" came to him and he retrieved his clothing. They were allowed to leave the craft, but found their car suspended in the mist. A blue light and whishing sound returned as the car was lowered to the highway, the speedometer indicating that it was going 55 mph (88 km/h), even though the rear end was off the ground. Conscious memory returned as the light and sound ceased. The time was 12:55 P.M. 


*Aftermath:* They stopped at a gas station, and ""Michael"" walked in semicircles as if drunk. The next day ""Mary"" found a rectangular mark on her abdomen, and soon had vivid dreams of a craft and entity. She developed a nearly fatal case of pneumonia, and while in the hospital learned that she was pregnant. The child was born two months early but was healthy and even precocious. The melanoma 
condition on ""Michael's"" legs improved. He felt stronger and more energetic than before and underwent a personality change reflecting greater openness and flexibility.

329,aliens,Reconciliation with faith,"Hi guys. So I spend a lot of time lurking on the sub and sometimes make a comment or two (not very often). And this has been covered many times under different questions but I want to seek info from people directly and their personal feelings. 

So the question is how do you reconcile your faith with the knowledge that alien life most likely exists?

This came about with a chat with some friends who are aware I'm Roman Catholic but they also know I am very interested in life elsewhere in the universe. They see a contradiction in my faith and the belief in alien life. I however feel that disclosure or the knowledge of alien life would reinforce my faith.

Now I just want to say a couple of things. I'm not preachy about my faith, I think it's a very personal thing and is different from person to person and I'm not here to try to make people believe etc. It's actually because it is so personal that it's sometimes difficult to discuss so the relative anonymity of Reddit allows a certain degree of freedom to ask. And one last thing - please try to be respectful. I don't want arguments, I just want personal experiences or ideas about reconciliation of the two points. If you disagree with people fine but we can be respectful. 

Hopefully a few people will share.

331,aliens,Ufos are Conscious Plasma Entities," 

Ufos are in fact plasma lifeforms probably living inside the sun or in our space. Here are some studies about Plasma being proven to be a living organism and a collection of articles wich point to one obvious point for me. Does these plasma have consciousness ? probably. These hypothese explains a lot of details about Ufos.

1.Sanduloviciu says this electric spark caused a high concentration of ions and electrons to accumulate at the positively charged electrode, which spontaneously formed spheres. Each sphere had a boundary made up of two layers – an outer layer of negatively charged electrons and an inner layer of positively charged ions. Trapped inside the boundary was an inner nucleus of gas atoms. The amount of energy in the initial spark governed their size and life span. Sanduloviciu grew spheres from a few micrometers up to three centimeters in diameter. A distinct boundary layer that confines and separates an object from its environment is one of the four main criteria generally used to define living cells. Sanduloviciu decided to find out if his cells met the other criteria: the ability to replicate, to communicate information, and to metabolize and grow. He found that the spheres could replicate by splitting into two. Under the right conditions they also got bigger, taking up neutral argon atoms and splitting them into ions and electrons to replenish their boundary layers. Finally, they could communicate information by emitting electromagnetic energy, making the atoms within other spheres vibrate at a particular frequency. The spheres are not the only self-organizing systems to meet all of these requirements. But they are the first gaseous ""cells"". Sanduloviciu even thinks they could have been the first cells on Earth, arising within electric storms. ""The emergence of such spheres seems likely to be a prerequisite for biochemical evolution,"" he says.

This research raises the intriguing possibility that life throughout the universe could have a very much broader basis that normally recognized. If plasma-based life can arise naturally, places to look for it could include the outer layers or interiors of stars (see [**Sun, life in**](https://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/S/Sunlife.html)), planetary [**magnetospheres**](https://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/M/magnetosphere.html), [**HII regions**](https://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/H/HII.html), and even [**ball lightning**](https://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/B/ball_lightning.html).

‘’Life on earth is organic. It is composed of organic molecules, which are simply the compounds of carbon, excluding carbonates and carbon dioxide. The idea that particles of inorganic dust may take on a life of their own is nothing short of alien, going beyond the silicon-based life forms favoured by some science fiction stories.

Now, an international team has discovered that under the right conditions, particles of inorganic dust can become organised into helical structures. These structures can then interact with each other in ways that are usually associated with organic compounds and life itself.

V.N. Tsytovich of the General Physics Institute, Russian Academy of Science, in Moscow, working with colleagues there and at the Max-Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics in Garching, Germany and the University of Sydney, Australia, has studied the behaviour of complex mixtures of inorganic materials in a plasma. Plasma is essentially the fourth state of matter beyond solid, liquid and gas, in which electrons are torn from atoms leaving behind a miasma of charged particles.

Until now, physicists assumed that there could be little organisation in such a cloud of particles. However, Tsytovich and his colleagues demonstrated, using a computer model of molecular dynamics, that particles in a plasma can undergo self-organization as electronic charges become separated and the plasma becomes polarized. This effect results in microscopic strands of solid particles that twist into corkscrew shapes, or helical structures. These helical strands are themselves electronically charged and are attracted to each other.

Quite bizarrely, not only do these helical strands interact in a counterintuitive way in which like can attract like, but they also undergo changes that are normally associated with biological molecules, such as DNA and proteins, say the researchers. They can, for instance, divide, or bifurcate, to form two copies of the original structure. These new structures can also interact to induce changes in their neighbours and they can even evolve into yet more structures as less stable ones break down, leaving behind only the fittest structures in the plasma.

***So, could helical clusters formed from interstellar dust be somehow alive? ""These complex, self-organized plasma structures exhibit all the necessary properties to qualify them as candidates for inorganic living matter,"" says Tsytovich, ""they are autonomous, they reproduce and they evolve.""***

He adds that the plasma conditions needed to form these helical structures are common in outer space. However, plasmas can also form under more down to earth conditions such as the point of a lightning strike. The researchers hint that perhaps an inorganic form of life emerged on the primordial earth, which then acted as the template for the more familiar organic molecules we know today.

( [https://www.sciencelearn.org.nz/resources/243-space-plasma](https://www.sciencelearn.org.nz/resources/243-space-plasma)

Stars like our Sun are made of ionised gas known as plasma. In fact, space is dominated by plasma – space scientists (astrophysicists) believe that about 99% of matter in the universe is plasma.)

3. Ufo resemble Earth formed Plasma which is not a Living organism.

And natural formation of Earth plasma has been used as a justification for the existence of Ufos.

‘’ ""Considerable evidence exists to support the thesis that the events are almost certainly attributable to physical, electrical and magnetic phenomena in the atmosphere,"" the report concludes.

Plasma is an ionised gas described by Sir William Crookes in 1879 as 'radiant matter' because of its tendency to glow.

A plasma effect is also responsible for spectacular auroras like the northern lights (aurora borealis) and southern lights (aurora australis), says astronomer Dr Paul Francis of the [Australian National University](http://www.anu.edu.au/).

Francis says he sometimes investigates reported UFO sightings at the Mount Stromlo Observatory, where he is a fellow, and plasma clouds provide a plausible explanation.

""It's quite clear that there are lights in the sky that people really do see and it's quite clear they're not aliens,"" he says’’

[4](https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/DOC_0000112352.pdf%20%0d4). Ufo interest in Nuclear Energy

Nuclear Fusion probably resembles the elements from which they are made of.

‘’Fusion is the process occurring within the plasma core of our Sun in which the nuclei of lighter atoms link to form a heavier atom. For example, when hydrogen nuclei collide, they can fuse into heavier helium nuclei and release tremendous amounts of energy in the process. What we see as light and feel as warmth coming from the Sun is the result of this fusion reaction process.

Since the Sun is a huge plasma ball made up primarily of [hydrogen](https://www.sciencelearn.org.nz/resources/1729-hydrogen-the-number-1-element), it is the fusion of hydrogen into helium that is responsible for 85% of the Sun’s energy output. The fusion of hydrogen to form [helium](https://www.sciencelearn.org.nz/resources/2759-helium) is a proton–proton chain reaction’’

5. Jacques Valle on Ufos

.’’The Super Physics of the UFOs

Most witnesses are not primarily reporting an object or a craft; they are reporting a light, a massive, multicolored, intense, pulsating light, a playful, fascinating, impressive, hypnotic light that is accompanied by strange sounds. In other words, UFOs may be unidentified, but they are not flying, as birds and airplanes fly, and they do not always behave as material objects. How much do we know from the avilable scientific literature about the effects of strong, pulsed, colored lights and other electromagnetic radiations, such as microwaves and gamma rays, on the human brain and on the major nerves? Pitifully little. Until this area is fully explored, we will only have a poor understanding of the physics of UFOs.’’

6.Moses Description of God

Taken from the Bible : ‘’There the angel of the LORD appeared to him in flames of fire from within a bush. Moses saw that though the bush was on fire it did not burn up. So Moses thought, ""I will go over and see this strange sight--why the bush does not burn up.""

Then Elisha prayed: ""O LORD, please open his eyes that he may see."" So the LORD opened the eyes of the servant, and he saw; the mountain was full of horses and chariots of fire all around Elisha ([2 Kings 6:17](https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/2ki/6/17/s_319017)).

7. In science fiction

In 1959, Arthur C. [**Clarke**](https://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/C/ClarkeA.html) wrote a short story called ""From Out of the Sun"" about astronomers at a solar observatory on Mercury who make an astonishing discovery during a huge solar flare:

We were looking at what seemed to be a translucent oval, its interior laced with a network of almost invisible lines. Where the lines crossed there appeared to be tiny, pulsing nodes of light... What we were seeing was impossible, yet the evidence was there before our eyes. We were looking at life, where no life could exist. The eruption had hurled the thing out of its normal environment, deep down in the flaming atmosphere of the sun...

332,aliens,ufo sighting?? pls help,"So about two months ago my mom and I were driving home on the highway. The highway was elevated and we had a pretty clear view of the sky. The sun had just about to set so the horizon was turning a little pink but it wasn’t that dark yet. Then, out of nowhere, a really electrical looking bright green light appeared in the sky. It was like the color of a vibrant green light like on a stoplight and pretty bright. It also had a pretty distinctive circular shape, but short of like if you squinted your eyes a bit when looking at a light. Also it was relatively close - still at a distance but it looked like if we drove for a while we could reach a point where we could be under it. Anyways the light appears and shoots down very fast towards the Earth on the left side of us, and it’s sort of shimmering so it looks like it’s getting smaller then bigger and then smaller again. Before it hit the treetop area it was shooting down towards it disappeared. And it was also moving VERY fast. I’m sure it wasn’t like a plane or anything because it was plummeting towards the earth and moving way too fast, also there wasn’t like an actual shape behind it, it was solely a light. I thought that maybe it could be like a star or something, but it seemed too close and it was still pretty bright out, and it didn’t leave a trail or path or anything. Not to mention it was also a neon green color. Both my mom and I saw the light as well, and were super shocked by it but idk anyone else that saw anything that day.

334,aliens,"This 1979 event began with a UFO that described as ""biblical"" by the witness, who, after realizing she had an hour of missing time and later a miscarriage, sought help from doctors (including hypnosis):","*Name/Date/Location:* Lynda Jones, 36; August 19, 1979; Didsbury, Manchester, UK

 
*Preliminary:* While hunting for wildflowers at about 7:30 P.M., Jones and her two children, Dawn, 15, and Andrew, 5, saw a strange disclike object in the sky racing toward them. As they crouched in the grass and watched the object drop out of sight behind an embankment near a river, they noticed that all normal sounds had ceased (both nature sounds and the sound of traffic from a nearby highway). 


*Initial activities:* Jones felt compelled to approach the site, at first walking and then running to the top of the embankment. About 30 yards (27 m) away on the bank of the river was an object that struck her as being, in some sense, ""biblical."" She felt drawn to the object, and as she approached a light on top began to increase in brightness. A rotating orange ball of light appeared from behind the object and 
began to move toward her. 


*Craft/Beings:* The object was about 60 ft. across, gray and crescent-shaped, apparently made of lattice work; the ground was visible through it. It was hovering about 2 ft. (0.6 m) off the ground, and seemed to disappear, reappear, then disappear again. A bright white light was visible on top. Dawn yelled at Jones to come back, and she turned and they fled home. Under hypnosis Jones later recalled seeing a person standing by the object just before they fled. She had a fragmentary recollection of being in a room and six beings dressed in dark ""motorbike suits"" with high necks entering the room. They appeared ""Oriental,"" with slanted eyes, very dark hair, and yellow/olive skin. She felt that she knew one of them from an earlier encounter. 


*Onboard activities:* After hypnosis she recalled being examined on a table. They put something on her legs that felt like pieces of ice. Whenever she tried to look at what they were doing, bright lights were shone in her eyes. 


*Aftermath:* When they reached home Jones's husband, Trevor, asked her what was the matter with her eyes. Her skin was red and scaley under her eyes. She noticed a period of about an hour of missing time. 
Within a few weeks she told her doctor that her menstrual periods had ceased. Strange marks appeared and disappeared on her body. She passed some unusual material and when she showed it to her doctor, he said that she had a miscarriage, though to her knowledge she had not been pregnant. A gynecologist found scar tissue on her fallopian tubes that did not conform to her known medical history. She also had  various other paranormal experiences in subsequent years.

339,aliens,"It seems just as probable as anything else that ""Gray"" ETs are relatively recent visitors","As far as I understand it, there are a handful models for what ET visitation on Earth has been and/or continues to be, if we accept the premise that we have indeed hosted other intelligences (I am choosing to not complicate the matter by resorting to the UT, or ultra-terrestrial, hypothesis):

**1)** The ET presence on Earth has historically been of major variety

**2)** The ET presence on Earth has historically been of minor variety

**3)** The premise of hypothesis #1 or #2, with the modifier that at least one of those ET presences has altered its appearance over time, thus giving a false impression of diversity

**4)** The presence of ETs on Earth was once more varied, but has diminished over time

**5)** The presence of ETs on Earth was once less varied, but has grown over time

**6)** The premise of hypothesis #4 or #5 with the modifier of hypothesis #3

Looking at these hypotheses, I can see one notable modifying omission: the matter of how persistent certain presences have been. For example, for the first or second hypotheses, it might be that there has been a regular coming and going of certain ET beings, regardless of how numerous their numbers may have been, or are, and that the ET presence has been relatively stable. This, in conjunction with the third hypothesis's modifier, actually seems to be a pretty prevalent conclusion in spaces dedicated to these discussions, but I don't see an extremely convincing reason for adopting it as the most probable model. It is a scientifically appealing model, though, because it makes the ET/UFO problem into not *phenomena* but a *phenomenon*.

Having said that, I think it is just as probable as anything else that the so-called Grays' presence here is relatively new, perhaps as recent as the 20th century. My rationale for this isn't conceptually hole-proof, but I really don't think any rationale concerning this topic will be. Here are my reasons for this conclusion:

**A)** The phenomenon of abduction experiences which involve machine-specific ""examinations"" and ""samplings"" -- the thing the Grays have the *most* apparent interest in, with regard to humans -- have pretty much no historically testified precedent prior to the 20th century. Of course, ""historically testified"" may be a blindspot, since many people tend to keep such experiences to themselves or only mention them in confidential conversation. But if abduction experiences are as common as statistics suggest they are, one would think that there would be *some* pre-modern international literature on the matter which could *at least* be interpretable as such. I would note here that hypnotic regression therapy is useful for coaxing these memories out, but their retrieval is not uniquely dependent upon such therapy. They can be recalled, for example, through synchronistic events which trigger the memories' resurfacing.

**B)** The image of the Gray appears to be an equally recent phenomenon. Paranormal encounters of the past do make mention of smaller beings, but, as far as I'm aware, none of these typologically conform to the Grays' appearance(s). I think we do humanity's cultural/creative diversity and the possible scope of reality a disservice when we conclude that, for example, any statuary with large and strange eyes simply must be historical depictions of Grays.

**C)** A casual knowledge of UFO literature would have one believe that Roswell was significant solely because it was the most well-documented case of a UFO crash with Grays, but there are in fact a number of other Gray-involved crashes with evidential trails of, if not equal, similarly impressive substance and cross-referential attestations (what makes Roswell special, if we are to believe Philip J. Corso, is that the retrieved material eventually led to a variety of seeded technology, such as the laser and integrated circuit chip). In my opinion, a possibility as to why UFO crashes seem as rare as they do is because governments and/or private military contractors have become so technologically attuned to these events that they can surround the relevant areas as soon as possible for retrieval. If this possibility is plausible, then UFO crashes historically seem like they should have been much more frequently observed, with the correlative consequence of interactions with Grays, alive or dead. Again, there is pretty much no literature, artwork, or other cultural artifacts depicting such events.

Again, none of this rationale is perfect. But what do you think?",skouon,4,,1644010064.0,3,0.75

Fist off an alien civialization that is 1000X more technologically advanced than us would probably have a craft that was unable to even crash. And if they didnt you would think they would have a system in place that would dissenagrate any evidence of their craft and beings inside if they did crash. They are so advanced they literrally break all the rules of psysics and logic. But yet there isnt any physical proof of this (except for eyewitness accounts and loghts in the skies) you can get anyone to say anything for the right price. So we have basically lights in the skies and eyewitness acounts. Also does anyone notice how their technology has evolved in 50 years? Rather slowly for such an advanced race would t you agree? Maybe thats what they were working on at Area 51. Maybe they were creating the crafts this whole time. The UFO'S always look like objects that appear futuristic yet seem to be made of material we have here on Earth.  Also it seems as if there are more UFO sightings in the united states than anywhere else in the world. When the Edward Snowden leak happened he went on to say aliens were not real.pop So why would the government want to put so much effort into something as big as this? Well what would be the one ghing that would get people all over the world to come together and accept a one world government? An alien invasion.,skf9u4,0,,1643986774.0,11,0.38

345,aliens,Do people believe in Alien life on earth?,"I will clarify this question a bit more:

1. Do people believe that Alien beings’ inhabitant our world today? Not microorganisms from comets but sentinel life. What are your thoughts of why you believe this?
2. And/or: Have alien visited us? In history, modern as ancient? What are your thoughts of why you believe this?

I am honestly curious of what people believe in this and hear what people have to say. I stand in the category “no” even though I would have been scared to death as well as thrilled to meet an alien civilization. I will state a few reasons why I believe aliens is not directly counter everything someone is going to say but to open discussion on why you believe otherwise and based on thoughts and reasons behind it.

I am not looking for conspiracy theories but rather people’s honest thoughts of Alien life on earth.

So some reasons of why I believe it next to impossible for Aliens to be on earth:

Distance.Distance between stars is immense.   

And everything is growing further away every day. Even at the speed of light it would take years to reach the nearest habitable planet.

Time of creation and Decay.Not everything in the universe is created at the same time. An example of what I mean is Mars actually. There are a lot of theories that when the Sun was hotter and younger Mars was a habitable planet with life on it. So “alien life” have existed in our little solar system. Just not at the same time as us. The same goes for most of the universe. The possibility that two species capable of interstellar flight exists at the very same exists but is very low.

But before that is decay. One theory suggest that the recourses needed to become an interstellar civilization is so high that a planets recourse that is habitable is exhausted before the civilization collapses. Earth is facing the same problem. Humankind isn’t working as one, but rather small fractions of scientists and groups of people is working for us to become an interstellar civilization. Because of these resources these small groups would need are instead focused on the current population’s entertainment or other selfish reasons. Not to become interstellar so we could mine rocks in our solar system.

Time and decay go hand in hand. The time for a civilization to become interstellar evolution wise is so slow, from what we know, and needs so many resources that by the time the civilization reaches it, or before, the civilization might collapse on itself due to lack of resources left on their own planet. This isn’t to the same to say that it is impossible, but it is an argument that says that it is highly unlikely.

Distance, Time, decay & travel time/speed.Traveling at a high speed.   

The speed of light. Maybe faster. This is something many scientists still work on how to achieve. Because traveling at the speed of light isn’t enough. Anything at or below the light of speed would be a one-way trip in a way unless statis pods are involved.But look to ourselves. If we would be able to create statis pods. Get a group of scientists on their way to a solar system and come back in statis pods for research they might not return to a home they know. Much less exist. It might be a risk they would be willing to take for science but the very same laws of time exists for an alien race if they haven’t figured means of accelerate faster than the speed of light without being crushed by the sheer force of the acceleration.

The sum of all this would also mean that aliens that can travel beyond our science knowledge with interstellar flights do it blindly. They might have calculated habitable planets in different solar systems, but they would be calculations out of thousands of years old data as our Hubble scope shows. Everything we see is “old”. Nothing we see is in real time. These same laws should apply for the Aliens unless they have invented something that can see starts in real time. So even if they have somehow had the possibility to break everything I have just laid out if would still be a “chance” of a million stars that they choose our solar system to visit.",sk5gae,13,,1643952985.0,35,0.71
346,aliens,This 1979 abduction includes what would soon became commonplace in this field of study: genetive exercises.,"*Name/Date/Location:* Jocelino de Mattos, 21, and Roberto Carlos de Mattos, 13; April 13, 1979; Jardim Alvorada, Maringa, Brazil 


*Preliminary:* Walking home in remote area at 11:30 P.M., the brothers saw a starlike object approach. As it did they heard an odd sound and felt weak. 


*Initial activities:* They turned and walked involuntarily toward a field, heartbeat rapid and body feeling a chill, and collapsed under a tree, losing consciousness. Under hypnosis, Jocelino recalled that someone 
came and floated them up to the door of a craft. 


*Craft/Beings:* No details. 

*Onboard features:* Jocelino was led into a room with computers, then another room with motors, a room with pictures or images on the wall, and finally to a ""medical room."" Roberto was not present.


*Onboard activities:* The beings examined Jocelino on a table, taking a sperm sample with a tubular device and placing it in a plastic package. Later instruments were attached to his head. A woman (not described) entered the room and she requested and he agreed to have sexual intercourse with her, then she left. 


*Communication:* The beings conversed among themselves in an unknown language, then told the Witness telepathically that they wanted to study the earth and that they are peaceful. They referred to wars on Earth. 


*Termination/Return:* They told Jocelino it was time to go, and took him to the door. They jumped out and floated him to the ground. He then felt paralyzed as the beings forced him to lie down at the base of the tree. As he regained consciousness he heard a voice saying that they would return. 


*Aftermath:* The brothers walked home with difficulty, arriving at 1:30 A.M. When they reached home, their legs felt weak and they collapsed. Their mother and brothers came to their aid, and at first doubted their 
story until they pointed out the ""ship"" hovering silently above the trees. As they stood talking, they felt a sudden shock and fell to the ground, paralyzed. Then the ""ship"" departed and they were able to function normally.

When asked for evidence of claims, I don’t want to be told the proof is found by “elevating my consciousness with hallucinogens to talk to aliens”. Really? Hallucinating is how I find aliens? Or is that just me hallucinating? 

When someone pointed out that space-faring aliens probably wouldn’t be water breathing because:

- water is too heavy to put into a rocket ship

-they would never develop basic technologies like metal working cause they wouldn’t have access to fire

-electrical devices wouldn’t work underwater 

-combustion engines wouldn’t work underwater 


The response was simply “the aliens could use their imaginations to overcome these issues.” As if not having access to fire is trivial. It’s fine if you disagree and think aliens could, but at least have solid reasoning and logic and arguments based on science.

351,aliens,"Roswell Cover-Up Analysis: Understanding Roswell is MUST, if you want to learn about UFOs and Aliens","If you get fooled by the Roswell Cover-Up story (Balloon/Mogul), then you are missing a critical piece of the puzzle. Plus, Roswell includes the main elements of UFOs, UFO crash retrieval, MILITARY cover-up, Alien bodies, Alien Autopsies, and Alien technology.  The Roswell Incident is really only missing abduction, DUMBs, and exopolitics.  So yes, Roswell is big.

The military and government was caught off-guard, so this incident was messy.  The public information is also a bit of a yard-sale, but in my opinion, THE FIRST STEP to understanding Roswell is to understand the cover-up.  If you don't understand the Roswell cover-up, then their propaganda has got you by the balls.

I think the best way to see the cover-up unfold is via the [Daily Illini newspaper article](https://idnc.library.illinois.edu/?a=d&d=DIL19470709.2.47&e=-------en-20--1--img-txIN----------). This article recreated timeline as the story hit the national AP newswire, and the Daily Illini article was written the day after the original story broke (July 9th, 1947).

[Daily Illini Article - Outlook of July 8, 1947 Roswell AP News Wire Story](https://preview.redd.it/uj3cl4u4vpf81.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8c630839e79794a2332eee81a3f8ab013ebde871)

When you analyze the Daily Illini AP Wires Burn With Captured Disk article, recognize that it started as an official release by the military base's public information officer, which was ordered by the base commander (Colonel Blanchard).

`4:26 p.m. (Central Timezone) ""Roswell , N. M. — The army air forces, here today announced a flying-disk had been found on a ranch near Roswell and is in army possession.""`

`4:30 p.m. ""Lt. Warren Haught, public information officer of Roswell field, announced the object had been found sometime last week. The object had been sent on to higher headquarters.""`

Again, describing a disk...

`4:55 p.m. the second add came, telling where the disk had been found.`

Colonel Blanchard must have given the order to release a statement to the local paper, because there were locals involved incident and word was getting out:

`5:09 p.m. Explained that the story had been broken by a radio reporter.`

After 40 minutes, the press in Washington D.C. was on the story...

`5:10 p.m. Addressed to editors that the Associated Press had begun to go to work on the story.`

Washington D.C. said... WTF?

`5:11 p.m. ""The war department in Washington had nothing to say immediately about the reported find.""`

1.5 hours later and this one is a BIG deal.  General Ramey discussed the ""disk"" and sending it to the Foreign Technology Division at Wright-Patterson.

`5:53 p.m. It was a story about a statement by Brig. Gen . Roger Ramey, saying the disk had been sent to Wright field, Ohio.`

And then main story hits...

`6:00 p.m. The NATIONAL headline was this: ""Albuquerque, N.M. — The army air forces has gained possession of a flying disk, Lt . Warren Haught, public information officer at Roswell army airfield, announced today.""`

Everyone is familiar with the local Roswell newspaper that broke the news as a Flying Disc on July 8th.  There was still time on the West Coast to add this story to the evening paper editions, so you can see that other newspapers also ran the ""flying disc"" story...not just the local Roswell paper.

[July 8th, 1947 - Roswell Flying Disc Articles \(West Coast Evening Editions\)](https://preview.redd.it/gkeg0qgovpf81.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=86cd8e44fdb1c0b7eb9657ab36f0d34efc906570)

Then 1 hour after the Flying Disk story went onto the National wire, we start to get the story from Washington!  Here comes the cover-up...

`7:03 p.m. The Washington story gave the first real hint that all wasn't solved. There were possibilities, it stated, that the object was only a meteorological device.`

`7:15 p.m. General Ramey would speak over the National Broadcasting company network.`

...and the ""official"" word from Washington that was to take precedence over all previous stories:

`7:29 p.m. ""Precede Washington. Lead all disk"" ... This meant that it was a lead to go at the start of a story to contain all material sent to that time.`

**It took 3 hours and 4 minutes after the national AP wire transmission to get their shit together and put the cover story in place!**

`7:30 p.m. ""Fort Worth — Roswell's celebrated ""flying disk"" was rudely stripped of its glamor by a Fort Worth army airfield weather officer who late today identified the object-as a weather balloon.""`

So, it took a ""weather balloon expert"" in Texas to properly identify a weather balloon?  Are the American Army officers at the world's only TOP SECRET ATOMIC BOMB military base this stupid?  They can deal with atomic bombs, but weather balloons are from out of this world!  Really, is this a joke?  That is the best cover story they could come up with?!?!

[Major Jesse Marcel got thrown under the bus...](https://preview.redd.it/3z0nu1i1wpf81.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=069a0e77719c67beaa57b0e5736db6eb61163aad)

In 1994, the military released even more propaganda, *Roswell Fact vs Fiction*, and said the weather balloon story was a cover-up for a gigantic balloon that was used to record Soviet atomic blasts: Project Mogul.

Major Jesse Marcel was HAM radio hobbyist, electronic technician, Army Intelligence Instructor, and CHIEF Intelligence Officer at Roswell, again THE TOP SECRET ATOMIC BOMB MILITARY BASE.  If it was the crash of a Project Mogul Balloon System, Marcel would have seen some copper wires, capacitors, electromagnets, microphones, and vacuum tubes in the wreckage.  This is like saying an automobile mechanic cannot recognize what an engine looks like!  Who falls for this stupid propaganda?

Why would anyone think Jessie Marcel, Colonel Blanchard (and anyone else that looked at the Project Mogul wreckage) would not recognize BASIC ELECTRONIC COMPONENTS of a sound recording system attached to a big balloon?!?!

&#x200B;

Here are two declassified FBI documents: July 8th, 1947 document discusses the transport of the disc to Wright Patterson, Ohio and that it is a matter of national security.  The second document from the same month discusses how the FBI wants to look at the Army's recovered discs.

&#x200B;

[FBI Directory J Edgar Hoover demanding access to the recovered discs](https://preview.redd.it/o59bvm1rypf81.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1d5ae9f0fca0d8b48800f1e2cfde5cf5e613ad2d)

Yes, the military cover-up operation kept the people of Roswell pretty quiet, and many Roswell propaganda documentaries (like 2005 Peter Jennings documentary - [https://youtu.be/BlDLDRT-whU?t=3135](https://youtu.be/BlDLDRT-whU?t=3135)) will say that Roswell was a non-issue until Stanton Friedman and Jesse Marcel discussed the issue in 1979.  This is not correct and here is a 1956 document that shows Frank Edwards discussing the Roswell crash to a UFO organization.  Also, it is said that alien bodies were not discussed, but FBI Special Agent Guy Hottel reported in 1950 about New Mexico UFO crashes and Alien body recovery by an informant (it doesn't specifically say Roswell).

[Pre-1979 Roswell Crash Claims and New Mexico Crash\/Alien Recovery](https://preview.redd.it/1af0rf5owpf81.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2ddeb604982202d5b5b363577c88f752c13c1719)

If you are starting to see that Roswell looks like a cover-up, I would suggest reading this eyewitness report from Chester Barton.  He was onsite at Roswell, but is a skeptic about the alien crash.  He is interviewed by another Roswell skeptic!  What this shows is that his eyewitness testimony of the crash site completely contradicts the possibility of any kind of weather balloon or Project Mogul crash.  In fact, Barton's idea of what happened would have been a **WAY BETTER COVER STORY** for military to use.  It is way more believable!

[http://www.roswellproof.com/Barton.html](http://www.roswellproof.com/Barton.html)

If you are convinced that Rowell was a cover-up, there is a TON of Roswell information available online.  When it comes to the actual crash event, you'll get many different stories.  

When it comes to the alien bodies, I would recommend reading [Colonel Corso's THE DAY AFTER ROSWELL](https://ia802804.us.archive.org/26/items/DayAfterRoswell/TheDayAfterRoswell.pdf).  He saw a Roswell alien body in 1947 and had access to the autopsy reports in 1961.  It is an interesting read.

Who were these these aliens that crashed at Roswell?  If you look at the pictures from the [1992 - Red River Canada Alien Incident](https://youtu.be/MoXrVZ5fbB0) and compare it to witness descriptions drawings of the Roswell Aliens (or photographs of Aliens from Military files), it seems the Red River incident could have been a Roswell EBEN.  These Roswell EBEN aliens are **NOT** considered to be typical *Grey Aliens*.

**Here is the translated text for the 1992 Red River Canada Alien Incident:**

In winter 1992, when I lived in Montreal (Quebec/Canada), a friend of my ex-roommate came to our apartment to show us some strange photos. The pictures showed that a creature of unknown origin - an extraterrestrial biological entity (E.B.E.) - and apparently lifeless, had been found by a snowmobiler (or maybe two) in a field or a woodland not far from the road. We immediately asked this friend where he had obtained the photos. He told us that they belonged to his cousin in the Red River area of L'Annonciation, Quebec.

Then, if I remember correctly, he told us that when the body was found in the snow, the snowmobiler (or one of the snowmobilers) went to get his camera (possibly a 35 mm). It should be noted here that if there were two snowmobilers, by the absence of one of them on the photos, we have no proof of his presence; unless he remained the only photographer. That said, other witnesses, obviously the two men (the two smokers) who can be seen in the photos, also went to the place of discovery with a car. Showing us one of the photos in particular, the friend in question had explained to us that the witnesses had to pass a cable or a rope under the arms of the biological entity, so that, with the help of a branch, they could lift it without touching it. It was possibly by precaution not to leave their prints or by fear of disease. We could suppose here that it had to give off a certain smell, considering that it does not look totally frozen.

From the photos, the cable or rope had obviously been attached to trees. Intrigued, we immediately asked him what they did with the body? And he explained to us that ""being late in the evening - and probably unaware of the importance of the matter - the witnesses did not dare to take the body back with them and when they returned the next day, it was gone. The witnesses therefore assumed that a coyote or other wild animal had probably found the body and brought it with it to feast on. On the face of it, this is questionable, but above all, irresponsible behavior. Considering that this kind of monumental error is often observed among non-scientists, it was not too surprising.

Afterwards, we asked him what he was going to do with these photos? And he answered that he was going to try to meet someone in the field of ufology, in order to try to elucidate this mystery. Anyway, before he left, I quickly grabbed my video camera and filmed the photos one by one.

A few weeks later, this friend called us back and told us that he had gone to show the photos to a person in the field of ufology - if my memory is correct, it was a certain Claude Mac Duff (1946-2001), author of the book ""Le procès des soucoupe volantes"" (éditions Québec/Amérique, 1975). The latter simply told him that it was not the first time that he had seen photos of this kind of entity, and that he therefore advised him not to try to make money with this story, or to waste time broadcasting it to the public, because he would certainly be discredited and ridiculed. It must be said here, incidentally, that during the investigation I learned that in the face of the obvious lack of satisfactory proof of the materiality of UFOs and extraterrestrial life, in the early 1980s, Mac Duff had joined the Quebec Skeptics, in which he collaborated for the rest of his life.

It is therefore not surprising that his conclusion was not preceded by an investigation of the witnesses of the time. It is a pity, because it ruined an important advance that we could have had in the field... Anyway, we were greatly surprised by this conclusion provided by the former ufologist. Not wanting to be taken for ""cranks"" or ""enlightened"", we simply decided to keep it to ourselves, as a kind of secret. We showed this video privately to open-minded friends and family, but not to the public.

Indeed, as is the case for most witnesses of unexplained phenomena, I was also afraid that if I presented this video to the public, people would end up laughing at us.",sk0g21,80,,1643938006.0,66,0.94

353,aliens,I saw an alien with my sister once as a kid,"So me(F19) and my step sister(18) grew up together for a long period of time starting from 8-today. 
  
 When we were younger we used to camp in New Hampshire at the Rumney pines Christian camp ground where our families owned a few campers and a cabin. 

 This happened about 10 years ago maybe a little less. One night during the summer time at around 7 pm, my step sister and I are messing around in our grandparents camper when it’s about time to go back to our parents camper for bed. 

  We get outside and the way that the campers are situated they were perpendicular to the road in a line. At the end of the line of trailers there’s a path that continues to a bunch of old and some renovated camp grounds that were used during the summer time and the second pool. It’s all dirt and mud road and the trees are plentiful. 

  We were walking from where the main road was towards deeper in the woods to get to our parents camper. When we started walking, I quickly saw something far in the trees making slight movement and so I stopped walking. Strangely enough, my step sister stopped walking too at the exact same time and we both said to each other, “do you see that??” All the way at the end of the line of campers towards the left of the road leading into the woods we saw maybe a 7-8 foot tall being with its head and shoulder poke out around one of the trees to look at us, stare for a couple of seconds, then slowly move back behind the tree again. It was really tall, kind of skinny with long proportioned arms at least it’s left arm. It was silver/grey with a big round head and short set shoulders. 

  Needless to say we both ran into the camper and told our parents about what we saw and were told to stop asking for attention.

359,aliens,Why can't we see aliens?,"I want to try and throw out a potential hypothesis that won't require having to estimate all the terms in the Drake equation, to simply arrive at a probability of aliens existing. I want to look at this in a much more fundamental way. I'll have to lay out some base assumptions I have that everyone may not agree with, before I answer the question directly. 

Before we can get to aliens, we have to dive deep to the Planck length and perhaps even beyond. It is my very strong intuition that the most fundamental thing in the universe is a bit. With a binary operator, you can achieve infinite upward complexity just by combining bits together to form bit strings. A smaller thing, a unitary operator, can't be the most fundamental unit because there is no way to create anything but the operator itself and we know what that looks like; the nothing that our universe is encapsulated in. Information theory is being used more and more in most fields of science and appears to be fundamental in physics and chemistry. I personally believe that the next big physics revolution will come once we prove the Mass-energy-information equivalency, but I digress. Back to aliens. 


The cool thing about bits is that everything can be represented by a bit string. 

This means ""Lex""

01001100 01100101 01111000

The reason we can convert bit strings into subjective language and vice versa, is that we came up with a coding scheme that's universally accepted for which string of numbers stand for what symbol. This is very important because this will help us explain why something could be right in front of us without us knowing. 

Since everything can be represented with a bitstring, and a bit is the most fundamental unit in the universe, you can think of the universe as one very long, objective bit string. In the example above where we spelled 'Lex', we knew what the bit string represented because we agreed upon a way of repressing each symbol. So to us, that string of bits makes sense because we have interacted with it. We essentially took an objective part of the universe and made it subjective for our purposes. 

Now let's reframe what might happen with natural selection at the most basic level. You have some process/observer/subjective entity interacting with a small part of this very long universal bitstring. As you interact with this bitstring, there are more and novel interactions to be discovered. Complexity in this sense is just being aware of and interacting with wider parts of the bitstring/universe. Let's move a billion years ahead to when we get humans. We have uncovered quite a bit of the bitstring. Here's the catch though, we uncovered certain parts with natural selection being the reason we see certain parts of the string and not others. Furthermore, there is a subjective component to this. If we receive binary code as in the example above, only humans will know that it spells 'Lex', because only we have interacted with that bitstring in such a way that we know what it means. An animal hasn't interacted with that part of the universal bitstring and just considers that arrangement of 0's and 1's pure noise. 

The reason we can see and interact with so many animals and parts of the biosphere on this planet, is because there are so many species that have overlapping interest on the same part of the bitstring. The part of the bitstring that's glucose makes sense to every organism that requires glucose. If there is competition or interaction on the same part of the bitstring, you're also very likely able to be aware of that thing. Dogs don't understand what a rocket launch is because dogs only have a very limited interaction with the bit string that aggregates to the concepts and things involved in launching a rocket; they interact with the bit string that is the photons bouncing off the body, the smell of it, etc. but they might as well be oblivious to the rest. They can only be aware of the parts of the rocket, where our interaction with the universal bitstring intersects. 

So now imagine that we send a message with those same bits as above into space. Let's assume that there is an alien life Form out there that also has radio telescopes and so forth. To that life form, our bitstring spelling Lex will be completely random and will mean nothing so they dismiss it as noise. The same goes for us. If we imagine then that there is a life form that grew up interacting with completely disconnected parts of the bitstring, we would never be able to be aware of them or see them until our interaction with the bitstring intersects. Of course we'll see plenty of carbon based species, because our utility functions mostly overlap so we care about the same parts of the bitstring.

Because we are a very young species and because you can 'subjectify' the objective bitstring in many interesting ways, we are likely not able to see a cosmos very much alive with entities we literally cannot imagine, because they are occupying a completely different part of the universe's bit string.",sjh29x,5,,1643888263.0,6,0.61

*Name/Date/Location:* Francisco Nunez, 66, and his son of the same name, 24; July 6, 1978; Mendoza, Argentina 


*Preliminary:* About 9:00 P.M., while driving south of the city, experienced a total change of environment and scenery. They found themselves driving at high speed on a five-lane highway surrounded by tall 
buildings. The sky, which had been clear and starry, now appeared red. 


*Initial activities:* Under hypnosis they discovered that their car had been levitated off the road, the engine failed, they were blinded by brilliant red light and felt very cold. 


*Craft/Beings:* None observed. 


*Otherworldly experience:* They found themselves in a strange reddish city with tall buildings joined to each other, and a wide, brightly lighted avenue. There were no signs of life. 


*Termination/Return:* Finally their car ""landed"" back on the highway about 9 km (5.4 miles) beyond the point where the incident had begun; the engine restarted, and they drove home. 


*Aftermath:* Both compulsively felt the need to wash the car, and Nunez senior to take a bath.

In 1967 over 70 people came forward over a several month period claiming to have seen a UFO over Stoke-on-Trent.

372,aliens,A Likely Scenario,"Premise:  This is a possible solution to “why they’re here”. It’s based upon the premise that Humanity is a macro-organism (pyrosome),and type-1 civilization (based on the Kardashev Scale).   

If we look at Humanity in its current state as a macro-organism, it would be analogous of an organism evolving a central nervous system.  

With the invention of the internet, Humanity now has the ability to communicate with almost the entirely of the globe; similarly, the brain of the organism now has the ability to communicate with all its entire body. 

What we don’t have in either example, is a brain that fully understands how to control the body.  That’s where growth comes in. Growth allows the neuroplastic brain to learn over time how to control the systems of the body, to ensure the survivability of the organism, and evolve. 

The reason “why they’re here”, is that there are more advanced macro-organisms in the universe that have already gone through this evolution/growth process; and when they encounter (or create) other potential macro-organisms, they “get involved” to ensure the organism survives.  That doesn’t mean they heal/fix the organism should they face destruction, but it does mean they ensure the organism doesn’t completely die off during its growth.  

Similar to a parent raising a child. They may step in should the child do something that would kill them, but they ultimately let the child make mistakes so that it can learn and grow. 

“They” are seen interfering and interested in our nuclear technologies. This is due to their knowledge that nuclear technology has the potential to “kill the child”.  

They’re here to monitor our “puberty” as a type-1 macro-organism. We first entered this stage when we became a global species. When we were found across every corner of the globe, and began to create small societies; and our evolving global neural network has been developing and evolving since.  

That neural network has now reached a point (thanks to Starlink) that we can communicate with incredibly low latency across the globe. We’re at the end of our first stage of evolution into a higher civilization/organism. 

The next step for Humanity, is to develop our systems of control (the “brain”) to ensure the health and survivability of the macro-organism. 
 
So, what does this mean for humanity?   What this means for us, is that we must all recognize we’re at a critical evolution point. If we don’t begin to control  our systems for the health and well-being of the entire macro-organism, the two outcomes are we either die off, or face de-evolution as a macro-organism.  

Like I said, they’re not going to allow us to die off (see our past genetic bottlenecks), so I don’t think a total species wipeout is going to happen; but it does mean that we will not evolve to be on their level until we recognize that our species on the whole is an organism, and use our knowledge and resources for the benefit of the organisms health and well being.

Edit:  while I appreciate the feedback from folks reminding me that humanity isn’t a type-1 civilization on the Kardashev scale; Consider the following:

- a type-1 civilization will be a defining characteristic (energy usage/consumption/control) of a type-organism.  

-  there are several characteristics of the organism that must be considered on a similar type scale. One of which, is communications across the organism.  Like yourself, or any other living thing, this means how well can the brain communicate needs and objectives amongst all cells within the body.  

-  if you compare the human race to a singular human, our species is equivalent to the skeletal and muscular system. We are the portions of the body which are capable of physically implementing change within the world. We lift rocks, we tend fields, we work.  Arguably, we are a type-1 skeletal and muscular system already, and we’re now finalizing our type-1 nervous system. 

Don’t get hung up on kedashevs definition of his scale.  The same principles which govern his scale of Energy usage can be applied to other aspects of existence.  You can find countless examples in physics, or when comparing systems.  It’s why we have universal math which works amongst all systems.",sir60x,144,,1643815143.0,49,0.89
373,aliens,Here is why the 'Dark Forest' theory may be wrong.,"If we're a threat to advanced aliens, one may wonder how they feel about each other.

&#x200B;

Humans are a threat? What about their alien neighbor that can do all the relatively advanced things they can do?

&#x200B;

Dark Forest theory may imply a single alien being that has somehow taken control of his species civilization, technology and everything, he's killed all the rest (because 'Dark Forest theory; universe is dangerous, kill them all) and now he's either on the march to ultimately exterminate all life other than his own, or he's waiting somewhere for an encounter with another being so they can then be almost immediately destroyed.

&#x200B;

Or it's an organization of extremely hostile aliens? But why would they not be hostile to each other?

&#x200B;

Extremely hostile aliens that learned to get along with each other near perfectly, with more power than any human has probably ever seen, and now have decided all outsiders must be destroyed. This is possible, how likely does it actually sound?

&#x200B;

To me it sounds nearly implausible.

&#x200B;

The truth may be they are really nice and compassionate because they have to cohabitate with advanced beings like themselves. If they can get along with something dangerous as one of them, are humans the ultimate threat that cannot be quelled without blood and war? Maybe.

The release of formerly **Top Secret** files late last year relating to President John F. Kennedy’s assassination gives some interesting insights into how a secret group could function during the late 1950s – early 1960s without Congressional or Presidential oversight. One of these Special Groups was known as the **40 Committee**, and the revelations of its operation and functions during the various investigative commissions from 1964 – 1975 demonstrate that it was indeed possible for such groups to exist. In this post, I posit that it, therefore, has parallels with another secret group that may have well existed at the time: **MJ-TWELVE**. It is my strong opinion that the project operations being run by both groups intersected in Dealy Plaza, Dallas on November 22, 1963

It is hard to interconnect all the dots in a single post, so I’ll just list the players and link the document from the released tranche. There are also some external links to the **Stratfor Wikileaks** emails and others that assist in obtaining a clearer picture.

The TL;DR of this post is, therefore:

**The U.S. National Security Council, in November 1963, had the internal machinery, funding and authorized personnel in existence to facilitate the liquidation of the leadership of any nation on the planet. If a leader was planning to reveal the existence of other intelligent beings to the global population, a special group of individuals within the NSC could easily have had that leader terminated.**

**The members / other involved persons:**

**President John F. Kennedy**

· After the Bay of Pigs fiasco, JFK wants to look at options to get rid of Fidel Castro. He tasks General Edward Lansdale with the job, which is code-named Operation Mongoose, under the policy direction of the Special Group (Augmented), which is the name used by the 40 Committee to reference themselves. SGA was a sub-committee of the National Security Council, created in 1959. [**Mongoose**](https://www.archives.gov/files/research/jfk/releases/2021/docid-32423491.pdf) pg. 8.

· JFK wants regular updates on the Project; Lansdale suggests an intermediatory be used. JFK decides his brother, Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy, be the conduit. [**Mongoose**](https://www.archives.gov/files/research/jfk/releases/2021/docid-32423491.pdf) pg. 19

· Reference to the Presidents’ knowledge of Mongoose was recorded in early 40 Committee documents, however, this is later changed to “Higher  Authority” in order to afford plausible deniability for JFK. The reference to “including liquidation of leaders” [**Mongoose**](https://www.archives.gov/files/research/jfk/releases/2021/docid-32423491.pdf) pg. 29 and “assassination” appears frequently in the 40 Committee documents, a fact which Lansdale and other members have difficulty recalling later on under oath. [**Mongoose**](https://www.archives.gov/files/research/jfk/releases/2021/docid-32423491.pdf) pg. 19. This is despite a specific directive to keep the subject of assassination “off paper” [**Colby**](https://www.archives.gov/files/research/jfk/releases/2021/docid-32112724.pdf) pg. 28, 37. A project that existed prior to Mongoose, ZR RIFLE, was to be used as the method to execute the plan. ZR RIFLE had strange objectives, both of equal importance: Assassinate foreign leadership **AND** “steal codes”. [**Colby**](https://www.archives.gov/files/research/jfk/releases/2021/docid-32112724.pdf) pg. 90. After the Cuban Missile Crisis, JFK directs Operation Mongoose to be terminated.

Unfortunately, JFK possibly created the liquidation program that would ultimately be used to liquidate him.

**Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy**

· Was the conduit between the Project Mongoose Manager (Lansdale) and JFK.

· Immediately saw the similarities between the objectives of Mongoose and the assassination of his brother, and possibly knows the motive (Disclosure) of the group responsible

· The day JFK is assassinated, Robert F. Kennedy asks John McCone, Director CIA if elements of Mongoose were used –“did your guys do it?”  [John McCone Archives - JFK Facts](https://jfkfacts.org/tag/john-mccone/)

· Known dislike of the ZR RIFLE executive authority, William Harvey (audio transcript).

**Major General Edward Lansdale**

· The Project Manager for Mongoose. A former Air Force General, he was made a Special Assistant to the Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara in early 1960.

· Transferred to CIA November 1961 to become Chief of Operations for Mongoose, a role in which he acted until early 1963.[**Mongoose**](https://www.archives.gov/files/research/jfk/releases/2021/docid-32423491.pdf) pg. 16 Lansdale then transferred to Vietnam to assist Henry Cabot Lodge during the coup to overthrow the Vietnamese Government leadership.

· Flatly denied certain details of Project Mongoose during the Church Committee hearings, until confronted with documentary evidence to the contrary. His performance at the hearing was described as a “train wreck”, which amplified suspicion that the CIA had more involvement in the JFK assassination than they were letting on. His main antagonist during the Church Committee hearing was a young, up-and-coming lawyer.

· Lansdale admits he has “lost control” of CIA Officer William Harvey. [**Mongoose**](https://www.archives.gov/files/research/jfk/releases/2021/docid-32423491.pdf) pg.34

**Secretary of State Dean Rusk**

· Attended SGA meetings occasionally

· SGA meeting held in his office August 10, 1962, where Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara mentioned “liquidation of leadership”. Lansdale initially denied the subject was raised, backpedaled when confronted with documentary evidence to the contrary, and then stated that the idea was ”turned down very hard” at the meeting. The young lawyer then asked Lansdale if that was the case, why did he task CIA officer William Harvey on August 13 1962 to “prepare plans for the liquidation of leadership”? Lansdale’s laughable response was “If I used the word liquidation, it didn’t mean killing”. [**Mongoose**](https://www.archives.gov/files/research/jfk/releases/2021/docid-32423491.pdf) pg. 21

**Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara**

· Attended SGA meetings occasionally

· Described by Lansdale as “a strange person”

· McNamara panics later on when stories began appearing in the press about plans to assassinate Castro and that Lansdale worked for him. He rang the New York Times to deny that Lansdale had ever worked for him when it was easily provable that Lansdale did report to him at some stage.

· Appeared to fall apart near the end of his political career. By 1967, McNamara was suffering visibly from the nervous strain as he went days without shaving and he suffered spasms where his jaw would quiver uncontrollably for hours.[\[160\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_McNamara#cite_note-FOOTNOTELangguth2000451-160) Johnson said about him: ""You know, he's a fine man, a wonderful man, Bob McNamara. He has given everything, just about everything, and, you know, we just can't afford another Forrestal"" (a reference to the first Defense Secretary, [James Forrestal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Forrestal), who committed suicide due to work-related stress and depression).[\[160\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_McNamara#cite_note-FOOTNOTELangguth2000451-160) [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_McNamara#Departure)

· Was this a consequence of being peripherally involved in the JFK assassination? Or, like Forrestal, had the knowledge of MJ-TWELVE's subject matter become too great a burden?

**William Harvey**

· CIA Signals Intelligence and Cryptology specialist. Former FBI agent, a lawyer by profession.

· Organised and executed the Berlin Tunnel operation, where crypto keys were stolen from the Soviet Union and allowed the U.S. to decode Soviet military communications.

· Organised the ground force for the Bay of Pigs, incensed when JFK refused military support for the ground effort. Felt that Kennedy had killed his team.

· Disliked “elitists” – particularly the Kennedy brothers

· Was the CIA Operations Representative under John McCone of the Special Group. Coordinated the ground infiltration of agents into Cuba. Attended the SGA meetings regularly. [**Mongoose**](https://www.archives.gov/files/research/jfk/releases/2021/docid-32423491.pdf) pg 17

· Was authorized to carry out Executive Action, which is a euphemism for assassination. He could do so **WITHOUT HIGHER AUTHORITY APPROVAL**. When the Church Committee heard that during William Colby’s testimony, they could not believe what they were hearing.

[https://www.archives.gov/files/research/jfk/releases/2021/docid-32112724.pdf](https://www.archives.gov/files/research/jfk/releases/2021/docid-32112724.pdf)  pg 73, 90

· Harvey was the sole custodian of ZR RIFLE, the program that had the weird dual tasking of assassination and stealing codes. Harvey did not have to get approval from anyone to carry out these tasks. He did not have to reconcile his spending on the program – his spending was charged to another cost center. [**Colby**](https://www.archives.gov/files/research/jfk/releases/2021/docid-32112724.pdf) pg 71

· Richard Helms, CIA Director of Planning at the time ZR RIFLE was created (1961) signed off on it and “authorized William Harvey by memo to handle the project on a special basis” in February 1962. [**Colby**](https://www.archives.gov/files/research/jfk/releases/2021/docid-32112724.pdf) pg 72

· Harvey reactivates ZR RIFLE in April 1962 and runs it through to an undisclosed date. The CIA leadership group of McCone, Helms, and Colby claim to only find out of this fact after the JFK assassination. [**Colby**](https://www.archives.gov/files/research/jfk/releases/2021/docid-32112724.pdf) pg 70

· Mongoose Chief of Operations General Lansdale thought he had lost control of Harvey and “things could fall between the chairs” with the operation. [**Mongoose**](https://www.archives.gov/files/research/jfk/releases/2021/docid-32423491.pdf) pg. 34

· !**READ THAT AGAIN!: A rouge CIA Officer with a known hatred of the Kennedys is the sole authority to plan and execute a program of Leadership Liquidation without oversight.**

· Harvey can’t believe the “stupidity” of General Lansdale for putting the words “liquidation of leadership” in a memo and asks for it to be removed. [**Mongoose**](https://www.archives.gov/files/research/jfk/releases/2021/docid-32423491.pdf) pg.36

* Tab H of the Burned Memo discusses a project named ENVIRONMENT. This project was most likely the codename to initiate the Kennedy Assassination operation using the ZR RIFLE infrastructure. It was so-named because the MJ-TWELVE ""environment"" is being threatened by Kennedy (Lancer)- ""***As you must know, LANCER has been making some inquiries regarding our activities which we cannot allow"".*** Dulles, as MJ-1, has already briefed the MJ-TWELVE group via the Burned Memo of the actions to be carried out when this eventuality is confirmed. This occurs via the ""John F. Kennedy to CIA"" directive of November 12, 1963 - 10 days prior to the assassination.

**CIA Director William Colby**

· The illegal activities of the CIA Counterintelligence Division under James Jesus Angleton’s HTLINGUAL and CHAOS, coupled with Watergate resulted in the Church Committee. Colby was the CIA Director at the time of the Church hearings and was forced to make a “limited hangout” of CIA’s activities to the Committee. Senior members of the intelligence community thought that Colby actually revealed more than he needed to. Colby was under severe pressure at the time – he attended 32 Congressional hearings during 1975 and also had a family tragedy when his 24-year-old daughter passed away that year.

· Colby was Director of the South East Asian division when JFK was assassinated, so he was most likely not directly part of the SGA. He was, however, aware of the existence of MJ TWELVE.

· The “Important Memo” from source S1 (Majestic Documents) on pg 1 states ***“You have been given information no one else has. To make my point a little clearer, remember a few years back when you got the JFK memo? William Colby got fingered in it and someone decided to shut him up before he was questioned about it. Coincidence? No way. He was not the first to be eliminated and won’t be the last I assure you”.***

At first, I was confused about which “JFK memo” this was referring to. However, reading an intercepted Stratfor email from the Wikileaks site, it was revealed that the memo is the one on the Majestic Documents site as “John F.Kennedy to CIA”. [kennedy\_cia.pdf (majesticdocuments.com)](https://majesticdocuments.com/pdf/kennedy_cia.pdf). The document on this site has the handwritten note on the side cut off – it should read “Response for Colby – Angleton has the MJ Directive”. The Stratfor email is sent to their “Tactical Team” as an assignment for study. Angleton died in 1987, so the only person still alive in 1996 is Colby. [The Global Intelligence Files - \[Fwd: \[TACTICAL\] James Jesus Angleton (training assignment - pls read)\] (wikileaks.org)](https://wikileaks.org/gifiles/docs/16/1641924_-fwd-tactical-james-jesus-angleton-training-assignment-pls.html).

· The MJ Directive that Angleton has is Tab H (last page) of the Majestic Document known as the “Burned Memo”, which calls for the assassination of LANCER, which was the Secret Service code name for JFK:  **“It should be wet” = wet works = “liquidation of leadership” = ZR RIFLE.**

· Colby, of course, dies in mysterious circumstances in a boating accident in 1996. A documentary by his son, Carl Colby, entitled “[*The Man Nobody Knew*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRnGOBGPiXE)” gives an interesting insight into Colby. The documentary was financed by the Guggenheim family and features all the major players from 1965 – 1975 in it – Brzezinski, Rumsfeld, Scowcroft, McManus, Bernstein amongst others. Well worth watching if you have the time and inclination. There is a bootleg copy on YouTube but it is poor quality and cuts off the top and bottom sections, which is annoying because you can’t see the names of the people speaking. Most are well known though. Appears to be an attempt to create a narrative that Colby killed himself – however, Colby’s other son denies that hypothesis.

· Some interesting timestamps are at 1 hour 02-minute mark, where they talk about the CIA “Family Jewels”; the 1 hour 04-minute mark on assassinations; and the 1 hour 11-minute mark about how Colby “**told them too much**”. This lines up with S1’s claim that Colby was killed because those in charge thought he would “tell them too much” about MJ TWELVE if / when asked.

· Another very interesting timestamp occurs around the 1 hour 05-minute mark. It relates to the Rockefeller Commission that was set up by Ford to investigate illegal spying on US citizens by the CIA. I am not sure who is relating the story, but he states the following: “*Sometime in 1975, President Gerald Ford is having an informal lunch with members of the New York Times Press corps. One of those present, Abe Rosenthal, asks Ford why he stacked the Nelson Rockefeller-led Commission on CIA Activities with right-wingers. Ford replied,* “***that’s a very good question. If I didn’t do that, the commission might have come across information far more serious than domestic spying”***. *Rosenthal replies* ***“Yeah? Like what?”,*** *to which Ford responds* “***like assassinations”***. *The discussion suddenly goes quiet and after lunch, the group goes back to the NYT office to decide what to do with the information they have just uncovered. The next day, Chairman of the Board and publisher of the NYT, Arthur “Punch” Sulzberger told them* “***the President misspoke. We aren’t going to do anything with this”***”. The fact that the CIA did have an assassination program did eventually come out, and the Rockefeller Commission was quickly superseded by the Church Committee that expanded the scope to all U.S. Intelligence Agencies.

· Colby tried to “clean up” the CIA, which also included the removal of incriminating documentary evidence. The fact that a project named MK-ULTRA existed was initially denied by the CIA, until receipts for the project were found in the CIA account’s department. Interestingly, a sub-project of MK-ULTRA was named ARTICHOKE, and is mentioned in the Majestic Document “Burned Memo”. [The CIA's House of Horrors: the Abominable Dr. Gottlieb - CounterPunch.org](https://www.counterpunch.org/2017/11/17/the-cias-house-of-horrors-the-abominable-dr-gottlieb/)

**Raymond G.Rocca**

· Ray Rocca was Jim Angleton’s most trusted Deputy, and Chief of the CIA Counterintelligence Division’s Research and Analysis section. He is not directly involved in the SGA or Operation Mongoose, but he is tasked by Angleton to “set the narrative” for the Warren Commission. [**Helms**](https://www.archives.gov/files/research/jfk/releases/2021/docid-32389862.pdf) pg 37

· Rocca is tasked to write a document that outlines the CIA’s position in relation to the Warren Commission, and the response CIA Director John McCone gives the Commission under oath. He writes an affidavit stating that the CIA had no contact or association, direct or indirect with Lee Harvey Oswald, a pronouncement denying rumors of CIA conspiratorial involvement in the assassination and also gives recommendations for McCone not to respond to certain questions to protect sources and methods. These statements for McCone to supply to the Warren Commission in 1964 were made before the ZR RIFLE project became known, and some of them would come back to bite the CIA in the Church Commission in 1975. [**Helms**](https://www.archives.gov/files/research/jfk/releases/2021/docid-32389862.pdf) pg 43

· Rocca makes the mistake of inserting the following statement for McCone to deliver to the Warren Commission: “*The DCI may state that he is gratified that his instruction have been carried out diligently and promptly. Among the items of information provided the Commission have been the studies on the organization and functions of components of the Soviet police state which are known to include individuals and units charged with the performance of what is euphemistically referred to as “executive action” – but is, in fact, charged with assassination and sabotage*”.

The hubris of the CIA in 1964 in “setting the narrative” of the Warren Commission’s investigations comes back to haunt them in the Church Committee Hearing in 1975, as McCone’s statement describes **EXACTLY** the organization and function of **ZR RIFLE**, which is described as “Executive Action”. Colby is therefore forced to reveal all the details to the Church Hearings on ZR RIFLE, including the possibility that rogue CIA Officer William Harvey could have easily initiated it **Domestically** without oversight to assassinate JFK.

· The seriousness of Rocca’s mistake is not lost on Colby – Angleton and Rocca are forced to retire. Angleton digs his heels in, and his replacement George Kalaris has to gently ease him out of the position. Angleton feels that Colby has betrayed him, as do Rocca and other current (at the time) and former CIA members.

· Kalaris now instigated an investigation into Angleton's filing system. His team found ""entire sets of vaults and sealed rooms scattered all around the second and third floors of CIA headquarters"". They came across over 40 safes, some of which had not been opened for over ten years. No one on Angleton's remaining staff knew what was in them and no one had the combinations anymore. Kalaris was forced to call in a ""crack team of safebusters to drill open the door"". The investigators found ""Angleton's own most super-sensitive files, memoranda, notes, and letters... tapes, photographs"" and according to Kalaris ""**bizarre things of which I shall never ever speak**"". (crash retrieval/occupants imagery / Twining White Hot report?)  [George Kalaris (spartacus-educational.com)](https://spartacus-educational.com/George_Kalaris.htm)

**Allen Dulles**

· Even though he was sacked by JFK for his role as Director CIA in the Bay of Pigs, Dulles is still a major player. Long thought of as the Chairman and MJ-1 of the MJ-TWELVE special group. Just like Apostle Judas Iscariot of the Bible,  he performs an act of treachery by issuing the directive for the assassination.

· As a member of the Warren Commission, Dulles still has a major influence in Angleton’s group within the CIA. Rocca makes a visit to Dulles’ house for a meeting to discuss elements of the Hearing. [**Helms**](https://www.archives.gov/files/research/jfk/releases/2021/docid-32389862.pdf) pg 159

· The “Important Memo” from S1 on pg 2 states that the MJ-TWELVE group “ceased to exist in 1969 and became a private concern financed by big money and big science”. Allen Dulles, the person known as MJ-1, dies in 1969.

**TAB G of the Burned Memo**

Tab G directs the MJ operatives to initiate BW - biological warfare in the case of UFOs displaying ""hostile intent"". It also instructs the use of ARTICHOKE, which was part of MK-ULTRA psychological operations.

378,aliens,"This 1978 case mirrors the same treatment we see in many cases including the witness being ""upgraded"" on a table and possibly having information embedded into his mind:","*Name/Date/Location:* William J. Herrmann, 25; March 18, 1978; Summerville, South Carolina


*Preliminary:* Herrmann sighted a silvery disc at 9:15 P.M. from marshy ground near the river. The object rushed at him and he was enclosed in a tubular beam of blue light from the craft. He became disoriented and numb and lost consciousness. 


*Craft/Beings:* Silvery disc about 60 ft. (18 m) in diameter. Humanoids 4-5 ft. (1.2-1.5 m) tall with large hairless heads, small jaws and mouths, slit nostrils, no visible ears. Eyes were twice as large as human eyes, reflective or glowing, and seldom blinked. The beings appeared frail and had pale, soft skin. Their clothing was red. 


*Onboard features:* Examination room with table, TV-like screen, flashing lights, curving hallway, another room with computers and other machinery, and an ""equilibrium manipulation"" room with spherical devices that were part of the propulsion system. 


*Onboard activities:* Herrmann regained consciousness in a hospital-like room that was glowing with red light. His shirt was open and a cold metallic box was on his chest. Three beings in the room looked 
back and forth between him and a row of flashing lights and a TV screen. His numbness went away and he was allowed to sit up. He was led on a tour through other rooms, then back to the original ""examination room."" There he was again placed on the table and he felt that 
information was being planted in his brain. 


*Communication:* The beings communicated without moving their  mouths (telepathy?). A ""leader"" or spokesperson, who said they came from Zeta Reticuli, reassured Herrmann and explained various parts of the craft to him. He was told that the beings had been observing earth for 50 years and maneuvered their ships in zigzag fashion to avoid the harmful effects of radar. The ""leader"" said that if we continued our warlike ways, civilization on Earth would collapse. 


*Termination/Return:* While the information was being implanted, the 
""leader"" told Herrmann that he would understand later. He passed out again, and then found himself on the ground looking up at the departing craft. It was after midnight. 


*Aftermath:* The experience remained vague and fragmentary until hypnosis was performed, which clarified details of the experience. Full memory returned about a year later. Herrmann had a similar experience almost exactly a year later.

382,aliens,Looking for more information on the Mantis beings.,"So I am finishing up the book ""Making Contact"" by Alan Steinfeld, the book is made up of several essays written by several different people.  Chapter 10 is called ""Awakening to our Cosmic Heritage"" and was written by Mary Rodwell.  In this chapter Mary talks about a few of the people that have supposedly made contact and have supposedly spoke to different types of extraterrestrial beings about where life in the universe comes from.  One of the contactee/experiencer a Jo Sheval Iskra recalled an encounter with a non-humanoid intelligence, a praying mantis-looking being that supposedly communicated with her, they told her that they were ""master geneticists"" and she wrote the following:

 *""In 2018 I was with a tall Mantis being and benevolent Reptilians.  They took me to a massive laboratory inside a cave-like structure. There were thousands of incubators with hybrids in them.  The Mantis told me ""they"" the Mantis were the ""keepers of the Universe."" They have blueprints and DNA for every species that has ever existed including extinct species on our planet. They populate planets with life-forms throughout the universe. They said they were proficient at genetically modifying human.""* 

Since I read that it has been on mind for the last week and I find it quit fascinating.  I started to become fascinated with them when I was reading some of Dolores Cannons work and one of her subjects spoke how a Mantis would sneak into her room at night when she was a child and stand over her really close and stare at her.  I have heard that the Mantis likes uncomfortable staring.  I also was intrigued again when somebody posted a story (I don't remember if it was in this sub or a different sub) about a guy that was lost in the woods of Canada and a Mantis being helped him find his way to safety.       

So now my obsession has really taken off and would like to find more about the Mantis beings, I was wondering if anybody here maybe has a story to share or if somebody has a source that I can read more about them.

388,aliens,Genuine question: Is there a need for artists to visually translate UAP and Alien encounter experiences (to help spread the story)?,"So I'm an artist myself and always had a huge interest in the topic. It started when I was around 5 or 6 years old, back in the day growing up in Japan watching paranormal and alien related programs at night. Never had the fortunate, or unfortunate, chance to see anything of unknown origin with my own eyes (expect perhaps the time I saw a person in a crowd without a face. But I could be mistaken, the person passed by me really fast. It's just that... I can't forget the sensation of how super weirded out I felt when I saw it). And I always wanted to experience it myself, obviously like many here.

Months ago, I saw a post around here (or on a simillar sub) debating about the need to gather artists, that could help illustrate the endless fantastic stories about UAP and Alien encounters. Traumatic or positive life changing events, I never thought about the possibility that those stories could be lost for the lack of a proper medium, that could've had helped captivate the curious and reach out to as many people as possible (if the one who experienced it wishes).

But I have to open my heart on this: I know this is a sensitive subject, and I don't want to be seen like I'm self promoting my work. Afterall, the focus is and will always be the person that had such experience. 

I thought for a couple of days, internally arguing with myself if it was right to even come here and ask about this possible 'demand', to illustrate the stories I read and watch about Extraterrestrial Phenomena.

Sorry if it violates any rule. I'm just curious if my art can help anyone (obviously as a job/project).

I don't 100% guarantee I will do it. It's a huge responsability afterall. But I wanted to know if it's feasible.

By the way, I don't normally do realistic artworks, and I suspect if there's a demand, they need realistic illustrations/comics. I could try to adapt to it though.

391,aliens,"Update on Majestic Document ""Authority of Director Central Intelligence Clarified""","Thanks to **Stanford University's** hardworking librarians, I have further information on the provenance of the contents of Majestic Document ""Authority of Director Central Intelligence Clarified"".

The TL;DR is:

* it is confirmed that President Kennedy did indeed write that memo to incoming Director John McCone on January 16, 1962
* The confirmation hearing, in this instance, was not ""closed"", so the content was publically available in March 1962
* The CIA had a copy of the hearing, and marked its classification as ""K"". This marking denotes that they were unsure what classification it actually was. The CIA's CREST automatic Public Interest release system determined in 2004 that it should be released in full.

Here is the information received from Stanford:

""*This Congressional hearing was distributed to Federal Depository Libraries (see the list of libraries at* [*https://fdlp.gov*](https://fdlp.gov)*). As far as I can tell, it would have been distributed to libraries sometime after 1/18/1962 (the date of the hearing), most likely 1-3 months after that date. I looked in the Government Publishing Office’s library catalog, and there are no notes there about it being “unpublished” or the hearing being in closed session or held back from distribution until 2003. As far as I can tell, every depository library which received the hearing back in 1962 (no doubt a large subset of all depository libraries since hearings are key publications for many libraries) would have had access to this hearing.""*

&#x200B;

*In looking at the “librarian view” of the catalog record (*[*https://searchworks.stanford.edu/view/3152996*](https://searchworks.stanford.edu/view/3152996)*) the date cataloged was June 19, 1996. However, that does not necessarily mean that that’s when we originally received the hearing. For much of the 20th century (up to the 1970s and further in many libraries) many libraries did not catalog their govt documents, instead relying on GPO’s “Monthly Catalog” (Monthly Catalog:* [*https://libsysdigi.library.illinois.edu/oca/Books2008-09/monthlycatalogof/*](https://libsysdigi.library.illinois.edu/oca/Books2008-09/monthlycatalogof/)*).* 

&#x200B;

*Here’s definitive proof that the hearing in question was publicly available from 1962. On p.35 of the March 1962 edition of the MoCat, #5062 is the hearing in question is listed. It’s p509 of the giant PDF at this link:* [*https://libsysdigi.library.illinois.edu/oca/Books2008-09/monthlycatalogof/monthlycatalogofj1962unit/monthlycatalogofj1962unit.pdf*](https://libsysdigi.library.illinois.edu/oca/Books2008-09/monthlycatalogof/monthlycatalogofj1962unit/monthlycatalogofj1962unit.pdf) *). So the hearing was definitely distributed to FDLP libraries in 1962 when the hearing was originally published.""* 

Lt. Gen. Marshall S. Carter's recollection of this memo in his NSA memoir was that it was provided to McCone shortly after Carter commenced his role as Deputy Director CIA in April 1962. Initially, I thought that with this memo (and the timing of its delivery according to Carter) Kennedy intended to separate McCone from the MAJIC compartment and allow Carter to run with it, as both Kennedy and Carter had prior exposure to the MAJIC events of 1947.  After the Bay of Pigs, there certainly was a sense in Washington that the CIA was a rogue agency - Senator Eugene McCarthy actually mentions the CIA being a ""Secret Bureaucracy"" on page 18 of the McCone nomination hearing transcript. However, on further research, McCone was likely to have already been ""up to his neck"" in the MAJIC space. He was appointed as a member of Truman's Air Policy Commission in the fall of 1947,  worked for Allen Dulles' brother John between 1954-58, (who was Secretary of State), and finally became the Chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission in 1958. The AEC is the most likely place that a nuclear propulsion system from a crash retrieval would be transferred to for further study. It is my belief now that McCone was intentionally installed as D-CIA in 1962 by the person who held the **MJ-1** designation at the time: **Allen Dulles**. Further to this, in the ""Important Memo"" Majestic Document, source S1 states ""*MJ-12 does not exist as a government intelligence entity. It ceased to exist in 1969 and became a private concern financed by big money and big science""*. Allen Dulles passed away in 1969.

So, where does this leave this particular Majestic Document? Given that James Jesus Angleton was known to hoard mountains of unimportant documents, my personal opinion is that the person who retrieved this tranche of the document suite didn't know it was unclassified and just collected it anyway. Although it is a genuine memo from Kennedy, it has little relevance now. 

Are we likely to find more examples of Majestic Documents in library repositories like this one?  I don't think so - most of the other Majestic Documents are **DRAFTS,** which means that they were never archived and this was a very intentional move to ""cover their tracks"".

Bear in mind also that I am fully aware that my own incredulity is not evidence for anything. These are just the random thoughts I’ve had today while bored as hell at work. But I was curious all the same to see what people would say. Sorry if this sounds incredibly dumb. So if I say something just completely wrong, I welcome the correction…but please go easy on me? Lol 

Because of media, aliens are often shown as somewhat human looking. But what if you had creatures similar to, say, a Portuguese man’o’war? That is, something that is a cluster of individual creatures that are distinct from one another, but cannot exist on their own. This would be something that could establish relationships within itself, and these would differ from the relationships it would have with other conglomerates. 

It may be that each member of a conglomerate could not say no to performing its function since it would die. It would be like a human saying “I will no longer eat”. The desire would just get the better of them eventually. So you would have a conglomerate of creatures who are self aware, but whose members cannot say no to other members of itself. Each unit is a community in itself. Perhaps sex is a purely diplomatic thing, and abstract concepts around it like romance do not exist, or are replaced by other concepts that do not and cannot translate to the human mind.

It isn’t a matter of them trying to work their understanding of things in to our understanding upon meeting. It’s the fact that the boundaries we would have to set may not be mutually understood. Because of our separate ideas of community, ethics around tit-for-tat or consent may not translate. Perhaps that civilization does not think anything of genocide. We would have to somehow communicate to them *”If you do such-and-such then we must retaliate”*. 

I know that’s a very round about explanation, but here’s what I’m trying to point to: I just worry about a relationship that, from it’s inception, must be maintained at gunpoint. It would not be stable, and without an understanding of cultural(?) nuance, we could never know exactly where the line is crossed. If anything, should we not be sending out diversions in to space, rather than directions to our planet as we have done? And if they are already here, should we not be bracing ourselves for the worst?",shfc65,16,,1643670766.0,18,0.68

397,aliens,Here's some woo that r/ufos ain't ready for.,"I'm just going to get right to what I *think* is going on and then explain how I got there. It's been a ride. 

Okay, so here's the deal. The phenomena and our experience with it is not unique to our species. A very long time ago some highly evolved intelligence/s, once having achieved a certain state of awareness about reality and their own place in it - this state being reached through a convergence of technical, spiritual and philosophical evolution - they found themselves a ""holy"" mission of sorts. 

You see, upon the realization that our reality is indeed the result of a creator intelligence - of which I suspect even our watchers understand little of - that created a material plane, injected itself into this world to know itself and evolve/grow itself, just as we strive to grow, learn and improve ourselves and our understanding of all things, these beings saw it as their duty to spawn, propagate and cultivate lifeforms so as to accelerate this process almost in service to the creative energy ( I'm not sure what I think about it being ""intelligent"" as all signs lead to it being a baby of sorts....and that our growth is its growth ) and we are just one of many, many worlds being grown and handled in ways we are almost ready to understand. This has been happening, and one day in the not so far off future - when we are ready - we will join them in this endeavor. 

If you look at the evolution of our species, of our philosophy, our culture, social systems, politics, art materials/physics/engineering sciences etc, I think there's an obvious path and destination for us. 

It's been a tough road, but it has to be to get here. It's a tried and true model, in fact. If you've been paying attention you've been watching a convergence in philosophy and physics as materialist science has not been able to explain what consciousness *is.* It's actually known as ""the consciousness problem"" these days. The answer to this problem is part of the key to reconciling the quantum world with relativity, the micro with the macro. The answer is inside of us, my dudes. Ohhhm.

398,aliens,"This 1973 abduction includes another event while driving at night--and the main event and details were all known to the witness without the need for hypnosis, which was later used to little effect:","*Name/Date/Location:* Mrs. Lyndia Morel, 20; November 2, 1973; near Goffstown, New Hampshire

 
*Preliminary:* A starlike object paced the witness as she drove at 3:30 A.M. As the object neared, it grew into an orange sphere and hovered low ahead of her. 


*Initial activities:* A being looked at her through a window in the craft and she felt paralyzed by the huge eyes, unable to look away. A brief period of unconsciousness or missing time may have occurred. 


*Craft/Beings:* Spherical craft with a honeycomb structure across its surface and an oval window. The being had a large egg-shaped head with grayish, wrinkled skin and no hair, a slitlike mouth, and large  egg-shaped eyes that slanted upward and had dark pupils. Under hypnosis she added that the being was her own height and dressed in dark clothes. She felt uneasy even though the being seemed kindly. 


*Onboard activities:* She had no memories of boarding the ship, nor did hypnosis reveal anything that happened during the time lapse. 


*Communication:* She heard a whistling sound and a voice in her head told her not to be afraid. She believed the being probed her mind. 


*Termination/Return:* She next found herself driving at high speed at a point 3/4 of a mile (1.2 km) from where she had been, while the object drew the car like a magnet. She pulled off into the nearest yard and threw off an attacking dog with extraordinary force as she ran to a house to escape. The entire encounter lasted perhaps half an hour. 


*Aftermath:* She suffered eye irritation and felt that someone watched her, but never again experienced chronic pain.

405,aliens,A little wild thinking based on my allergy,"While scratching my allergic reaction on the back, I was thinking if anyone’s suffering the same: allergic to all metal but gold. 

And a little bit wild in thinking, if the gold is needed on molecular level to fix the atmosphere, maybe it is needed biologically for the extraterrestrial being…Like oxygen formed the ozone of earth and the same elements is carried in our bloodstream, what’s needed for the planets are fundamentally needed by the life conceived on that planet. 

Then overlap the universal phenomenon of warship to gold…maybe our creators replaced one essential elements—gold in their gene to … iron (just an assumption considering their similarities on structure) and that might be the key to find the pre-longed life due to the nature of gold which might result extremely long cycle of metabolism?

Edit: For those who suggested the nature of gold n iron are different, yeah I guess I’ve aware of the difference. So another possibility would be eliminating instead of replacing. After all we are only 2% different from chimps. Since gold is found free in natural surroundings, most likely it would stay the same free status in an organic system. The amount needed for organic creatures most probably is on minimum level just like other minerals copper/zinc/iron in human body. So an acidity instead of basicity blood is possible. And the acidity shouldn’t be strong——if you asking why, just look at your blood and asking how come iron is in it while the hp value is around 7.5-8 n it’s liquid. However, if gold does turn out to be an elements in a organic creature, highly likely the blood is going to be orange in color which suggests their skin might be extremely white considering the supporting system is acidity based",sgs66z,4,,1643603007.0,4,0.63
406,aliens,A strange encounter I had when I was young - aliens or something else?,"Reddit crashed on me when writing this so had to start over, there’ll probably be less detail in the OP so feel free to ask questions about anything you want me to elaborate on in the comments. I’m not sure if this event involved aliens or ghosts or something else entirely, but I still remember this event quite vividly, and am not sure how to explain it. I’m a skeptic, but open-minded to consider possibilities outside the realm of science to explain this, since I can’t think of any scientific explanation myself. This event happened roughly 8 years ago.

I was approximately 7-8 at the time. My parents had been fighting and my dad was kicked out of the house, I’d been sent to bed. I slept in my parent’s room facing the window, which had a gap between the sets of blinds. The blinds were white, and any insect or bug that climbed up the window outside would have it’s silhouette reflected on the blinds. 

There was a tapping coming from the window, and my dad appeared from the neck up through the gap in the blinds outside the window. I could see a small bit of the shirt he’d been wearing earlier though. Problem with this is, the bedroom window was on the second storey. The only thing below it was plants from the garden, there were no footholds, trees or anything that could have enabled my dad to climb to that spot. 

He started talking to me, making gestures to go along with his words (think: speaking to a small child and doing actions to go along with your words so they understand you better) as he told me not to let my mom know he was there, and that he was going to go to sleep in the garage. Problem with this is, my dad wasn’t speaking aloud, it was more his voice talking very clearly in my mind. I’m also deaf (35% hearing) so there’s no way I would have heard him so clearly, especially not through a window with cars driving down the street.

The last thing I remember of him “speaking” to me was him making an action of going to sleep and telling me to close my eyes. I closed my eyes only partially, leaving them open enough to witness my dad scuttle onto the rooftop with just his arms like some strange animal. I vividly remember that his body ended at the torso, watching his silhouette behind the blinds as he moved. My dad certainly had legs, and certainly didn’t move like whatever this thing was.

I immediately rushed to the living room and told my mom that my dad had been outside my window and climbed onto the roof. She went outside with a flashlight to check and found no evidence of anybody there, no footprints, no disturbance of the dirt or plants in the garden, no marks on the window, nothing in the garage.

My dad came back to the house the next morning and seemed utterly confused when I asked him why he was outside my window the night before. He showed me and my mom proof that he’d been at a hotel all night (I believe the proof was a calling card with the name and phone number of the hotel, I don’t recall exactly but it was definitely something to do with a hotel). I still insisted that there’s been somebody outside the window so my mom and dad both went out to check that morning and still found nothing and told me to stop making up stories.

I’ve thought about this a few times over the years, and still can’t find a plausible conclusion for what I encountered; the one thing I know for sure was that I wasn’t asleep or hallucinating, I’ve never experienced hallucinations or a dream like this in my life-it was far too real for me to have been sleeping.

421,aliens,Theory on 'Who' are in the UFOs,"My theory about who are in the UFOs. Yes, I know it's a slight twist on Chariots of the Gods before you mention it.

I have been heavily researching the occult subjects such as; UFOs/UAPs, Remote Viewing, Lost Ancient History, Religion and so on for a few years now. I only use what I deem to be valid information and sources, which is whomever or whatever seems to have the most credibility. I have listened hundreds of pieces of media including podcasts, interviews, books, etc.

Anyone dedicated to the investigation of UFOs knows that they are very real. They’ve been seen in ancient times by our ancestors. They are depicted in paintings and talked about in historical accounts, sometimes described as flying disc or shields. They’ve been filmed daily by hundreds of people with cell-phones and cameras for many decades in modern times. Tracked on radar, thermal cameras, high quality visual sightings and even possible abductions. Governments are evidently beginning to admit that they exist – and that they’re most likely not of human origin.

I want to focus on WHO is in, at least, some of the UFOs.

Many have likely heard of the Sumerian gods called the Annunaki – I propose these begins were/are not a myth, but we're, in-fact, real. 

The Sumerians are considered one of, if not the oldest civilizations and most likely the first to develop modern literature. On some of these tablets, they discovered the Enuma Elish - The Epic of Creation story. It tells about the creation of Man as a slave species after a war between the Annunaki and another race, called the Igigi, in which the Igigi were severely defeated.

According to some interpretations, they possibly came from the planet Nibiru, which apparently orbits the Sun once roughly every 3,600 years.  

There is currently strong evidence to support that there is indeed another planet yet undiscovered but will likely be soon:

https://astrobiology.nasa.gov/news/caltech-researchers-find-evidence-of-a-real-ninth-planet/

Many believe the Bible has it’s origins/roots in this story, as this story predates the Bible by roughly 2000 years but has a lot of the same narratives. In-fact, it would seem the Christian Bible is simply a rewritten and revised account the original tale. Afterall, Genesis: ""And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness"".

It is said some of the Annunaki or in the Bible, ‘Fallen Angels’, descended to Earth to mingle with human females and that a race of Giants was born from these interactions. When men could not longer sustain the giants, the giants turned against them and devoured mankind. As well as all other animals on Earth, including each other, drinking the blood of anything they could find. In short, they were cannibals.

The Annunaki decided these acts could not go unpunished, this brought upon the Great Flood which washed away all living things including most of the giants. You probably know the rest.

I propose: What if, the Annunaki, Fallen Angels and/or Giants are still alive to this day? What if they are in possession of advanced technology, such as anti-gravity or displacement craft?

Lou Elizondo has stated before in many podcasts that if we knew the truth of our origins, we would be ‘somber’ and that it would be ‘sobering’. He went on further to say that we may not know our true history and that we might not be at the top of the food-chain and that another species might be higher on that ladder. This also heavily suggested in the TTSA books: Sekret Machines: Man, and Gods. Along with much discussion about alteration of DNA, blood/human sacrifice and such.

Here’s that part of the interview:  

https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=5320&v=wULw64ZL1Bg&feature=youtu.be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=5320&v=wULw64ZL1Bg&feature=youtu.be)

This suggests there is another known species that’s higher on the food-chain. In the same interview he has said ‘Yes’ to there being occupants in at least some of these crafts, suggesting they contain an actual being and are not simply just automated AI drones using advanced technology.

We’ll assume these beings require sustenance. This could be the reasoning behind cattle mutilations(food), the apparent loss of fresh water from lakes/rivers and several missing people all around the world, especially in National Parks.  

Yes, people have reported seeing UFO’s draining fresh water from lakes.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIHk\_WUsk5A](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIHk_WUsk5A)

According to what I believe to be the leading investigator, Linda Howe - it’s not just cattle, but every type of animal around the world. (Sound familiar?) There have even been reports of human mutilations, although apparently rare.

Lou has said several times that these beings may not necessarily be extraterrestrial and that they may be ‘ultraterrestrial’ – meaning they’ve been here all along and either originated on Earth or simply settled here before Man.

I propose these beings were the Annunaki or at least their descendants. Possibly their giant predecessor demigods.  

If true, according to legend, these beings were huge – possibly 8-15 feet tall, possessing immense strength and able to perform unimaginable, god-like feats and in possession of otherworldly technology.

Then I would bring many of these humans back to my home world to be shown to the others. There would be many parties celebrating my great discovery and advancement of these other creatures and together we would rule the galaxy.

And if they rise up against me, a rival worthy of a hyper advanced alien civilizations military might. Practice for my soldiers at the least, or quite possibly the most epic battle in the history of the galaxy at the most.

429,aliens,what if the phenomenon is controlling disclosure?,"I heard Ross Coulhart say during his “That UFO podcast” interview (around the 43 minute mark of episode 167) that ‘the phenomenon is making disclosure inevitable’. he goes on to say that ‘the phenomenon is making itself so obvious, so overt —that it’s impossible to not collect data on it’. to the point that military personnel are seeing these things very frequently. and that got me thinking….what if the phenomenon is the main driving force behind disclosure?

perhaps the whole purpose UFOs have had gradually showing themselves to humanity (hide and seek, playing chicken, abductions, etc.) for the last 70 years is to slowly desensitize the public to the idea of visiting extraterrestrials. perhaps they are acutely aware of the drastic impact a sudden shift of belief would be on an international scale (i.e landing on the white house’s lawn). and so maybe these civilizations have specific “conditioning” guidelines they must follow when revealing themselves to indigenous life forms on other planets for this purpose. 

perhaps the reason military sightings have ramped up recently is due to the new military  guidelines requiring personnel to report these sightings…. which representatives of the people will later be privy to. now that our chosen representatives are being exposed to this data, perhaps these military sightings will continue accelerating in an effort to remove any remaining doubt the public (at least in the US) has regarding this topic.

this of course implies the phenomenon 1-cares about disclosing themselves to humanity, and 2-that they know what’s happened since 2017 regarding disclosure. all of this is obviously speculation but i just found it interesting how these encounters have recently accelerated and also how it doesn’t even seem like UAPs care when they’re seen (and how often) by the military. 

on a side note i’ve found Ross Coulharts interviews to be some of the most interesting/illuminating on this topic. i strongly recommend anyone to listen to any of his interviews regarding the phenomenon.",sfrj1i,70,,1643489880.0,35,0.87

I theorize that some alien race has been easily learning every weakness and detail about humans, and they will eventually decide to take control. 
If the government had been truthful from the start, perhaps we could have delayed or prevented ourselves from being so easily researched. Additionally, we could have made progress toward figuring out who they are, what they want, and if we could benefit from a relationship.

433,aliens,My Alien Encounter,"When I was young, around the age of 8 or 9, I used to sleep with the blankets over my head. I was tremendously afraid of the dark and the things that my mind would imagine to lurk in the dark. I remember on more than one occasion intentionally peeing in bed because I had to go really bad but I was too frightened to walk to the bathroom in the dark. I state this all for context.

One night I awoken lying on my back. My blanket was tucked in tightly under feet and under my head which I would commonly do when I would first go to sleep at times as it was easier to breathe as the blanket was lifted off my face. However, it wasn’t a position that would remain long as one twists and turns to find a position they were comfortable to sleep in.

There was an amazing white light that was coming from my window. My blanket was thin so the lighting in my room was always discernible from under the covers.

A hand that looked like it had three thin fingers, scrolled over my face from the top of my head going downward. 

I was not terrified. I wasn’t scared. I didn’t scream for my mother. My eyes were just open and observing.

The next day I told my mom and sister what I experienced and my mom just dismissed it as a dream and I never brought it up to her again.

I don’t remember dreams very well. But that one, over 30 years later I remember in incredible detail. I’ve come to believe I wasn’t dreaming at all. It was real. I remember it like a memory.

434,aliens,Physiological Connection Provides Evidence For Parapsychology Connection + The Road To Human Development.,"The phenomenon has guided humanity throughout history via mythologies. 

These nuanced stories with common threads, later lead to religions. 

Beliefs lead to actions which lead to Sociocultural and Sociopolitical shifts. 

Vallee’s Control System.

As we continue to experience the convergence of the Material and Metaphysical through the expanding interest in Ufology, it’s hard not to ask if the mixed bag of results the phenomenon had on us were perhaps necessary for the advances we're seeing in human development: 

The effects of the Control System resulted in divisions via religions, which lead to wars, colonialism, racism, sexism and stubborn beliefs re our differences. 

An apparition or prophets w ‘superhuman’ powers were the primary influences for these movements. Accounts which have overlaps with modern ufology. 

It is this hostile environment which we still find ourselves in, that has lead towards tech, spiritual and moral advances: 

War and defence from those w opposing views was the prerequisite to exponential tech development. Equally we are more accepting of others than in the past thanks to our previous experiences. 

Vallee in Magonia and Invisible College explains that the phenomenon presents itself w as much “absurdity” as “logic”, with as much evidence for a threat, as benevolence.
 
""The Phenomenon Negates Itself."" 

It’s as if it had to present itself through mythologies first to garner the trust of the layman. It had to present itself as a threat in order to garner the attention of the highest echelons of tech development - defence organisations and contractors. But it had to occur in this order.

[The main idea here is that disclosure coming from the political structures would likely not garner the belief of a population who had no related experiences. We find this problem in those who have not examined the historical literature, believing it’s a staged alien invasion as they’re unaware we’ve been seeing this since recorded history.] 

We've arrived at a point where our science has begun to explain the materials and propulsion aspects: 

We have the phenomenon to thank for this. I refrain from quoting cases but a more modern example is the dropping of tech around the world and the interference w nukes - taunting Russia and US during Cold War, Skinwalker, Hessdalen, etc...

The Consciousness aspects and the Parapsychological overlaps are too, beginning to be explained w the Materialist approaches which are much required:

[The Big Think on experienced meditators emitting Gamma in wakeful states: https://youtu.be/jCJdl6Vs7wg] 

[Winner of the BICS contest Dr Jeffrey Mishlove compiles interviews w many Parapsychologists who have been studying the overlaps w Ufology for decades:https://www.youtube.com/c/NewThinkingAllowed]  

In fact when you take a closer look, you realise Parapsychology has more cred and research than Ufology. The disdain of the Materialists to engage in these conversations is detrimental to our development and understanding of what we’re dealing with. Good for lobbying, not for uncovering the truth.

This brings me to the heading of this post. A clear set of explanations will begin to emerge from the Consciousness approach, just as they're emerging in the Materialist fields for the physics approach to acquiring similar tech. 

Just as we're seeing in Physics, the data will come with a clear set of rules we will need to follow in order to be Psychologically prepared and morally Responsible with the possible ramifications of Disclosure. 

Many in the sub categories of religious beliefs have been claiming much of what is now starting to be proven - from OBE's, NDE's to ESP to the importance of Meditation and Love (research referenced below).

We're witnessing the convergence of Science and Spirituality, of the Material and Metaphysical. Are you following? 

We're at the start of a New Religion, backed by Science. 

Garry Nolan's research I would argue provides the latest evidence for what should constitute a 'Good Human' - a 'Future Human'. A contribution towards the Science-backed Commandments, if you will, of our new frontiers. Practices that will allow us to attain the next step in Human Consciousness. 

Sound familiar? 

A modern religion which converges Spirituality and Science. 

The latter is proving hard evidence for the path to development through what has till now been described as spiritual/occult practices and beliefs. Need I elaborate?

If you examine the history and take a Sociological approach, you notice the modus operandi has remained constant: 

The phenomenon picked prophets and disciples to direct humanity in certain avenues. 

It’s always worked this way and is still happening:

Many great minds that have shaped our world have said to be in contact w entities or guided by an apparition, a voice or intuition. A study of the Marian Apparitions is a good example. 

More modern ones include Newton, Parsons, Haim Eshed, John Dee, Joseph Smith - who uncovered the “Book of Mormons” after having ufo-type encounters since 14 and influenced many including the late Harry Reid who was part of LDS. 

The Nation Of Islam was too formed around a UFO myth - a modern religious movement that included Malcolm X and Muhammad Ali. 

The list goes on if you're looking through the lens of the Phenomenon - UMMO; The Seekers/Guardians; Uri Gellers Followers; and many other cults that influenced the direction of research and science. 

Deep Prasad too, claims to have had what he thinks was an abduction, https://youtu.be/SVvH9km12ns https://youtu.be/7A0EO-VMI3A.

Many podcasters also claim to have experiences like Jay from Project Unity: https://youtu.be/rJvtuHhYX-Q

The man that runs the Martin Fleischmann Memorial Institute YT (mentioned by Ross Coulthart) claims his father, a high degree Freemason, brought him out one night where an Orb appeared shortly after arrival: https://www.youtube.com/c/MartinFleischmannMemorialProject

The Phenomenon picks it's Prophets.

In a Ted Talk, Vallee talks re the importance of science to study what he calls “..strange coincidences..”, following to suggest these could be a form of communication w a higher intelligence, and how people like Carl Jung were experiencers of these 'intuitions and precognitions' (https://youtu.be/S9pR0gfil_0). 

In the Invisible College, Vallee describes the group as influenced by “Rosicrucian Ideas"", who believe that ""it’s members posses secret wisdom that was handed down to them from ancient times..” https://imgur.com/a/pvQbJIs. 

We can only imagine that the stigma has reduced the experiencers talking re their stories. But those at the forefront of this research have been responsible for much of our current technological achievements (SRI on ARPANET for example, Dee on navigation and spying - the OG 007).

I argue that we are seeing the formation of a body of research which will lead us towards Human Development: 

An undeniable set of practices will arise from a movement some researchers like Pasulka correlate to a modern religion.  

What we are seeing is the modern Scientific Prophets compiling their work into what one day could be compiled into the Bible of this modern religion. With a set of Science backed 'Commandments'. 

Nolan's research suggests to me the importance of engaging in a life that increases the performance of the Caudate Nucleus and it's relationship to the Putamen. Inducing the same effect in our collective psyche that Meditation research has produced. And the same effect the Parapsychology literature has produced - bringing many to related practices of Remote Viewing and related ESP as well as meditation - and the ramifications of these movements affect our collective direction.

As we progress, more signs directly related to Ufology will arise, alluding to practices that will pave the path of Human Development - RV, Meditation, Inducing OBE's and other topics which were as fringe as the UFO Phenomenon. 

Whatever the correlation might be to the Phenomenon, the argument can be made that there are great benefits in having the traits of the 100 experiencers in Nolan's research. A short summary of my assumptions below. 

To me, research like this is akin to the commandments, and perhaps what is meant by us ""not being ready"" till we achieve this next step.

“Science works by comparing things that are similar and dissimilar to other things. Enough people were having very similar kinds of bad things happen to them, that it came to the attention of a guy by the name of Dr. Kit Green.” - Garry Nolan 

Nolan studied 100 DOD/USG/ Aerospace Personnel who had close encounters w UAP. 

Findings show they all had an “over connection of neurones between the head of the Caudate and the Putamen.” (hypermorphism). A very rare characteristic.

…medical records showed they had this trait before their encounters:

 (“…something people were born with…”)

[https://www.vice.com/en/article/n7nzkq/stanford-professor-garry-nolan-analyzing-anomalous-materials-from-ufo-crashes]

On the Caudate [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caudate_nucleus]:

Motor Functions:

- “…involved in coding a motor response…in the recruitment of the motor system to support working memory performance by the mediation of sensory-motor transformations.”

- “…contributes importantly to body and limbs posture and the speed and accuracy of directed movements.”

Goal-directed Action:    

“A review of neuroimaging studies, anatomical studies of caudate connectivity, and behavioral studies reveals a role for the caudate in executive functioning…” 

- Executive Functioning:

“…selecting and successfully monitoring behaviours that facilitate the attainment of chosen goals.”

- “…the caudate is fundamental to goal-directed action, that is, “the selection of behavior based on the changing values of goals and a knowledge of which actions lead to what outcomes.""”

- “…study involving EEG and fMRI measures during human sleep cycles has indicated that the caudate nucleus demonstrates reduced activity during non-REM sleep across all sleep stages.”(Suggesting activity during REM).

“(Involves)…selecting and successfully monitoring behaviors that facilitate the attainment of chosen goals.”

Emotion:

- “…implicated in responses to visual beauty, and has been suggested as one of the ""neural correlates of romantic love"". Approach-attachment behavior and affect are also controlled by the caudate nucleus…”

The putamen and caudate are also both related to addiction, concentration and reward systems. [think tech and effects on humans].

The Brain Wave State Graph [https://imgur.com/a/laA3yc8]: 

“…reduced activity during non REM sleep” suggests (the caudate nucleus) is  active during REM..

Look at the graph, it correlates w intuition, ESP, access to unconscious mind, meditation, “hypnogogic visualisation..” 

- also backed by the brain wave chart and caudate nucleus being correlated to love. 

- the correlates in Nolan’s research also provide soft evidence for OBE’s and other UAP related parapsychology traits. 

It will be difficult for many to accept some of the premises here. The patterns are there. What’s important is to remember that the Phenomenon presents as much logic as absurdity - it had to be this way for the formations of religions and so on. Meaning all the minutia within religions are not important. 

TLDR: We're experiencing the convergence of the Materialist and Metaphysical approaches to Science. We're simultaneously being presented with the emergence of a Science-backed Religion, with the potential to be the last frontier of such movements. This is resulting in a clear set of practices that expand our individual and collective Consciousness. Just as a clear set of physics is emerging in the attempt at developing UAP inspired tech, so is the same occurring for our Consciousness studies. A clear set of practices are emerging, akin to the Biblical Commandments, that will be required if we are to attain the next step of evolution responsibly.",sfh543,164,,1643459212.0,64,0.92

I keep in my mind the work of David Jacobs, where he goes into depth about the theory of an alien hybridization program, as well as the theory that aliens are simply future humans, with evolution just making them look different to us, though still with the basic bipedal shape. Ross Coulthart has stated this hypothesis in a few interviews, promoting his book.

But what if both theories are correct? What if the future humans  in UAPs are actually hybrids, who comprise the totality/near totality of the future of humanity? They have been on earth for multiple generations and have supplanted *Homo Sapiens* just as we supplanted *Neanderthals*. These hybrids combine traits of humans and aliens, which gives them cognitive, physical and paranormal abilities far in excess of ours. Perhaps they are hundreds or a thousand years into the future. Who knows? But their existence has advanced humanity (if that can be considered the right word) far quicker than if matters were left to evolution.

436,aliens,Electronic Telepathy,"Electronic Telepathy, or e-telepathy, is a sub-trope of Telepathy.

However, in some cases, a character will have no natural or supernatural telepathic ability and instead use a Brain–Computer Interface to gain this power. In this form of telepathy, thoughts are converted from impulses in the brain (electric activity produced by neuron reaction potentials) into digital signals that can then be broadcast artificially to another e-telepath using radio waves or some other form of wireless communication. Obviously, this can lead to Mental Fusion or even a Hive Mind, just as non-technological telepathy can. This form of telepathy is different from others in that it does not allow Mind Reading, since a person must be actively transmitting a signal in order for another to receive it.

""Oh yeah if aliens are actually real and so advanced then they could probably read my thoughts, so why don't you just cut the power to my house right now"" 

Before I even finished my thought the power cut and chiils went over my entire body as I sat frozen for about 5 minutes.

439,aliens,Animal mutilations and the greater implications,"In the last several weeks I’ve tried to research and understand this topic in more depth. After doing so I have a few observations and a couple questions.

Observations 

1) While cattle mutilations get the headlines, many other mammals have been involved, including dolphin, horses, dogs, cats and marmots. Cattle are the most common mammals on the planet at about 1bb.

2) The earliest documentation of the phenomenon was recorded by King Edward several centuries ago.

3) There are a few basic variations in cases but far more similarities. Some of which include, cuts made with surgical precision, specific organs removed including single ears, ‘cored anus’, missing tongues, missing male genitalia, missing udders, exposed jaw bones, and the big one….not a drop of blood to be found anywhere, which rules out earlier theories of predation and ‘satanic cults’.

4) The phenomenon has been reported in every country around the world with the exception of India. Coincidentally (or not) the dominant religion in India is Hinduism which holds cattle as sacred.

5) The total number of reported mutilations is unclear but anecdotally it seems pretty staggering

6) Eyewitnesses have reported seeing lights and metallic orbs in the area. In a few cases witnesses reported seeing cattle being lifted to a ship in a beam of light. As with crop circles there are some pictures and video of these small metallic orbs near cattle.

7) Police, FBI, scientists and others have investigated many cases over the years with no conclusive findings

8) Many people are convinced (as am I) that these mutilations are being perpetrated by aliens. 

So here are my two questions. (I find it interesting that in all I’ve read and watched on the subject, I’ve seen few if any people asking #2.

1) I’ve seen only 1-2 theories from alleged abductees who claim to have been told by (reptilian) aliens the reason(s) for these mutilations. Assuming you agree aliens are responsible, what credible reasons have you heard for the mutilations being conducted? 

and the big one….

2) Most moral humans would consider the wanton mutilation of animals (allegedly while still alive) to be cruel, immoral, insensitive and unnecessary, etc. Not to mention the theft of valuable property without regard to compensation or consideration of the owners.

So, what does all this say about the morals and values of these ‘highly advanced’ beings and their egregious lack of compassion and respect for the animals and life in general? Not to mention a lack of respect and consideration for their owners. The whole picture doesn’t bode well for a healthy relationship between us and them. Morals and compassion seem to have advanced in a different direction than their intelligence. Right? So WTF does that mean for humans? “Yes, yes, it’s true. We’ve stolen and butchered every mammal on your planet at some point but loosen up guys, we draw the line when they’ve got opposable thumbs”. ?!?!                             👽😱🤞🙏😅🖕🏿",sfc0na,16,,1643437996.0,34,0.84

I'm not saying it is 100%, but it MIGHT BE, IF we can get a better quality video from Mark. A higher resolution capture from the MINI-DV tape could provide DIRECT proof of the symbol on the UFO or not.

[ 2003 New Westminster, BC UFO & UMMO Emblem ](https://i.redd.it/0a0v7ku83ie81.gif)

 Verification of this symbol is a very big deal, because it would tell us that this UFO is from UMMO. These are neighbors of ours in the Virgo constellation. They have spent the last 70 years learning everything about us and then attempting to help us. So, given that track record, it would be pretty easy to say these are the goods guys and are considered ""Nordic"" (not tall white).

If you are tired of alien abductions and negative ET shit, then I suggest learning about UMMO. There is a TON of interesting information available and it is helpful, positive information versus ""somber.""

Full HBCC UFO Report of the New Westminster, BC Canada video from 2003:

`British Columbia Reports / 2003 - New Westminster UFO Footage - Breaking News Coming !`

`Report From HBCC UFO Research Director - Brian Vike ©2003 HBCC UFO`

`UFO Footage Shot On August 11, 2003 at 6:20 p.m. PST.`

`I was contacted a while back by a gentleman by the name of Mark who had told me he had some excellent footage of a UFO, or an unknown object which he took on August 11, 2003 using his new JVC mini DV, GR-d90 camcorder.`

`Mark's wife was the first to take notice of the unusual object. She was standing in her kitchen at the time. She moved quickly onto the deck of the family's home and was surprised, or should I say shocked to see an unknown object hovering over the trees close by. She said it flipped over and it turned a bright blood red. She screamed to her husband to come quick to watch this strange thing in the sky.`

`As he arrived on the deck he saw a cigar shaped object. He thought quickly, ran back into their home and grabbing his brand new camcorder he scanned the sky for the object and began filming. Eventually when he lost sight of the object he went back inside and played the tape over and over. To his surprise and everyone else's .. what he saw completely shocked him.`

`Mark quickly contacted Peter Davenport at the NUFORC in Seattle, Washington in the United States to file a report and told Peter what he had caught on tape. Mr. Davenport passed the report onto myself (HBCC UFO Research) and Gavin McLeod. Gavin made arrangements with Mark to visit him and take his report and to view the video footage.`

`A couple of days after speaking with Gavin, Mark sent out a portion of the footage to myself, Gavin McLeod, Mr. Jeff Rense and a number of others who may have found the Quick Time Player UFO footage of some interest. Many did find it interesting but one immediately ruled it as ""a helium filled foil balloon"".`

`""This material below is from my observations of this tape.""`

`Mark and I corresponded and discussed the video footage. In one of our telephone conversations he mentioned that he'd not bothered to slow the tape down. When the running speed of the footage was slowed down greatly, some interesting things started to appear. Mark suggested sending me a copy of the original tape he'd filmed so that I could have a better look at it. When it was slowed down it was apparent that this was no ordinary ""helium filled balloon"".`

`As the fellow started filming, the object drops down from the sky, then enters from the top of the screen. Mark at this point has the camcorder zoomed in and catches the object making sharp turns as it goes down, moving to the right, then back to the left, drops down, moves right and back to the left, always making sharp movements downwards until it disappears very quickly........ What it does next is very interesting. From out of the east (its position where it disappeared) .. it reappears, still glistening, and travels west at a steady pace. At one point it makes a complete stop.!!! Then it moves south towards Mark's position. When using the Quick Time Player to view his footage one can notice that Mark zooms in on the object and catches what looks like an aura surrounding it ... for a short period of time. He also films what may be the underside of it, until it slowly moves away, turning on its side, taking on a clear saucer shape and it appears to be discharging a dark unknown substance. The strange discharge occurs twice. One from the left side of the object and the other from the right.`

`Again Mark tries to find the object in the sky but can't seem to locate it. He zooms back out and finds nothing. He continues his search zooming out and in and for a split second he captures it once again in the very spot he was searching and where previously there was nothing. The camera again picked the object up and it seemed to come out of nowhere and was gone again as quickly as it appeared.`

`Regarding the Quick Time Player internet clip..... I have heard a number of things about the footage, but not once have I heard anyone mention the discharge which comes off the object just after it flattens out and before it disappears from view (or when the object is lost due to Mark trying to focus in on it). If you take a good close look at the internet footage, you will notice two of these types of discharges , one to it's left and the other to its right. )`

`I found it interesting when viewing the footage that the day before, on August 10, 2003, Mark was filming his family's visit to the Abbotsford Airshow, which is a major happening every year and draws aircraft from all over the world. The video footage clearly shows an aerial display of known aircraft taking place the day before the sighting happened.`

`One other note I would like to make, which I found to be very important also, was the remark made by Mark's mother-in-law who was speaking in her native Romanian tongue as she watched the object perform in the sky. She made a comment and Mark translated for me... ""the bottom of it has turned brilliant bright red"".`

`Conclusion:`

`1. The object makes extreme sharp maneuvers.`

`2. The object travels at a great distance and then returns from the direction it came from.`

`3. At one point in the video, the object comes to a complete stop and hovers.`

`4. The bottom of the object changes it's color to almost a blood red.`

`5. The object ejects a black substance on two occasions.`

`6. In some parts of the film it travels at an extreme rate of speed.`

`7. In one portion of the tape the object looks like it has an aura around it.`

`8. There were a number of witnesses to this sighting.`

`What the object is for sure I am not certain. It was extremely interesting, extremely puzzling, and who knows what it was.?? I spent hours viewing the video .. over and over again.... at all types of speed to try and determine what it might have been .. all to no avail. I enjoyed it immensely and found it very exciting. With Mark's permission I will be forwarding it on for further examination.`

445,aliens,"Should we put more thought into the UFOs/UAPs are Russians and Chinese, or American theory?","We still don't know what the hell these things are in our skies. So it's easier to assume it's tech by the USA or another country.  It's, even more, easier to assume all UFOs/UAPs are just balloons and birds. It's easier to assume humans and mundane things are behind this phenomenon because that is all we know so far. That is what we are used to.

What I mean by the title. Is should we explain why the UFOs/UAPs can't be the USA or another country tech, more often. Note im not saying UFOs/UAPs are not man-made by humans. I'm just saying should we at least question the man-made UFO theory more often on this sub.

I'm doing this post because of the way UFOs/UAPs act in our skies. I don't know if im the only one who sees this. Or im just reaching here. But do you guys ever notice how strange UFOs/UAPs act? Like it's not human or something. Guys im not saying it's aliens Lol. I'm just saying the behavior seems very alien.

Ask yourself this question. If this tech from UFOs/UAPs were truly made by Russians, Chinese, or Americans. They why would human beings go to military bases out in the open? Does that seem like human behavior to you? You would think if Russia or China had this tech the world would never know lol. Because usually, human beings work in the shadows, not in the open. Sure there is a good possibility these crafts might be remote-controlled by Russia or China. But my point still stands. Why the hell would they want to be open in the public to people. Secrecy is ingrained in our DNA. We are like ninjas.

Again it's almost like these UFOs/UAPs behaviors seem not human a bit. For starters, the UFOs/UAPs don't care about being watched or observed by people. The objects are just there in the skies, just chilling on military bases. When in human history have human beings ever been out in the open and not discreet at all.

In conclusion

Either Russia, China, or America think they are invincible, to the point where they can do god-level trolling on military bases lol. Or something else is going on here.",sewq2n,0,,1643393070.0,9,0.39

447,aliens,This 1973 abduction case included an entire family and deceptive communications from the kidnappers. It happened during the major 1973 wave of UFOs & humanoids sightings.,"*Name/Date/Location:* Mrs. Patty Roach and four children, especially Bonnie, age 12-13, and Debbie, 6; October 16-17, 1973; Lehi, Utah

 
*Preliminary:* Mrs. Roach, a divorced mother of seven children, was moving into a new house and fell asleep on the couch. Her youngest boy sleeping beside her awoke and screamed that he saw a skeleton. She thought she saw an intruder, and heard the family cat and neighborhood dogs barking, so she called the police at 12:10 A.M. They arrived and searched unsuccessfully for a prowler. Bonnie, age 12 or 13, and Debbie, age 6, told the police that the prowlers really were spacemen, and Debbie described the interior of a ""spaceship."" Mrs. Roach remembered seeing a bright light outside prior to falling asleep. 


*Initial activities:* Under hypnosis Mrs. Roach recalled that she awakened to see a bright light shining on her and her youngest son floating away while two beings stood nearby. These beings held her by the upper arms and drew her out of the house. Other beings escorted the three struggling children. They floated through a hatch. 


Craft/Beings: The craft waited hidden in a nearby field. Mrs. Roach did not describe the exterior, but inside was a round, bright room, with stars visible through a window near the top. The beings were just over 4ft. (1.2 m) tall and skinny, their faces masklike and white with large elongated eyes and a straight mouth. They wore luminous uniforms with Sam Brown belts, gloves, and helmet-like headgear. They had long arms with three-fingered, clawlike hands and small thumbs. 


*Onboard features:* The room contained machines like computers, a clocklike device, glass cases full of liquid, and a floating table. A human male about 55 years old, balding and wearing glasses, assisted the beings. Debbie described an Indian girl in a long dress on board. 


*Onboard activities:* Efficient in their work, the beings treated Mrs. Roach like a specimen. She undressed and laid on the table while wires were attached to one leg and arm. A gynecological examination followed, including insertion of a needle into her abdomen without pain. Another needle was inserted in her head to ""take her thoughts,"" a process she resented but could not resist. Bonnie recalled watching a group of beings and a human male as they stood around a table where her naked mother lay. The Indian girl placed Debbie on some kind of machine, and Debbie recalled a line of people waiting to get on a floating table. 


*Communication:* At the onset a being asked Debbie her name and assured her she would not be sick anymore. The beings questioned Mrs. Roach about what she loved and hated, and she understood that they had urgent need to understand human thoughts and emotions. The human was kind but seemed deceptive, and tried to trick her into believing she had taken a ride in the craft. 


*Termination/Return:* The beings wiped her with a cloth and returned her clothes, but refused to answer questions about the safety of her children. They were back in the house before the beings grasped her arms and floated her back onto the couch. The beings placed the children in different places from before and departed by the time Mrs. Roach and her son awoke with fragmentary memories. 


*Aftermath:* Debbie was sick just after the police left, but she no longer suffered any chronic illness. Mrs. Roach and Bonnie found pinpricks on their upper arms that healed within a few days. Nearly two years passed from the kidnapping before Mrs. Roach began to explore this experience.

They mention humans. I had been doing Bigfoot field work and found strangely that ufos would sometimes show up in these wild areas. Some I have caught on video. Though they tend to be traveling very fast. Sometimes silver saucer type craft doing things no 'known' tech can do. I wonder too if some of this is a follow-on affect from going to the outskirts of Skinwalker Ranch in 2013. Watch the whole thing not just 5 minutes. The voices are toward the end.

Okay so this is a very true shower thought I had today. 
You know how the people of earth are just sending stuff into space? Like radio waves, telescopes, rovers. And what ever else. Maybe that isn’t such a good idea. I’ll be honest. I do believe that somewhere in this universe there’s life. Possibly far more advanced than we are currently. So maybe someone is hearing these radio waves and they’re just not dumb enough to broadcast their location to the entire universe.

My reason for not believing in aliens is:

At least ONE alien race should have expanded exponentially. So Aliens should be everywhere but we see none they should be covering up not just stars but whole galaxies but we find like 2 stars that look sus.

Life is hard, life spontaneously existing might be so rare there is not a single other life form out there in the observable universe.

The universe is (probably) infinite, but the observable universe is finite, and even at the speed of light we will never reach or even see some places. This means anything outside of the observable universe might as well not exist.

I don't believe the laws of thermal dynamics can be broken, nor can anything ever travel faster than light, so no I don't think aliens can come from outside the universe or hide their thermal dynamic activities. And even if they could it just makes the exponential expansion problem worse.

This leaves us alone in a vast universe. Which I actually find terrifying and unnerving, far more so than having alien civilizations out there.

457,aliens,"This now-obscure 1968 abduction in Vermont known as the ""Buff Ledge Case"" was noteworthy because a number of corroborating witnesses who had not compared notes beforehand all described parallel events:","*Name/Date/Location:* ""Michael Lapp,"" 16, and ""Janet Cornell,"" 19; August 7, 1968; Buff Ledge Camp, Colchester, Vermont 


*Preliminary:* Standing on dock at 8:10P.M., glowing, cigar-shaped object swooped down over lake, released three small round objects. Two streaked away, the third approached witnesses. Two beings visible in dome. 


*Initial activities:* Beings communicated with Lapp telepathically, Cornell seemed to be in trance; witnesses abducted on board. 


*Craft/Beings:* Disc with dome, perimeter lights. Two humanoids with large heads, large eyes, tight-fitting grayish clothing, seen in dome. Three or more seen on board (roomful at one point), greenish clothing, green-blue skin color, about 5 ft. (1.5 m) tall. 


*Onboard features:* Dim lighting, exam tables, equipment, instruments, consoles, viewing screens. 


*Onboard activities:* Lapp and Cornell examined separately, each escorted by a ""guide."" Cornell: eye exam with handheld light, skin scrapings, blood sample, bodily fluid samples; Lapp: helmet-like device placed on head, monitored on viewing screen by aliens. 


*Communication:* Telepathically with Lapp. They allege they came from a distant planet; he would not be harmed. Told him probing of Cornell was for ""spawning consciousness."" 


*Termination/Return:* Guide touched Lapp's hands and he found himself in a strange landscape, people in park-like setting, purple sky (like the Higdon case?) then lost consciousness. He awoke falling through space, TV-like screens showing image of him and Cornell on dock; passed through a screen and awoke on dock next to Cornell. 


*Aftermath:* Both felt fatigued, went to bed without discussing incident. Lapp retained partial memory; Cornell had near-total amnesia, sensing only that something had happened that she wanted to talk about with Lapp. Ten years later Cornell approached UFO investigators, and Walter Webb initiated a five-year investigation (see case summary by Walter N. Webb below).

#The Buff Ledge Abduction 
by Walter N. Webb

The Buff Ledge encounter is significant in at least two respects: (1) unlike virtually all other known cases of multiple abduction, the two principals involved did not discuss their shared experiences afterward. So their testimony, on which there is remarkable agreement, is uncontaminated; and (2) the five-year investigation remains the most thoroughly probed and documented of any single UFO abduction episode in the literature (in 2000).

 
On August 7, 1968, at Buff Ledge Camp for girls on Lake Champlain (Colchester, VT), ""Michael Lapp,"" 16, a young waterfront maintenance worker, and ""Janet Cornell,"" 19, the water-skiing instructor, stood alone on the end of the camp's 110-ft. dock at about 8:10 P.M.


Most campers and counselors were away from Buff Ledge on a two day break. ""Michael,"" who had more conscious recall of the UFO experience than ''Janet,"" reported that just after sunset a glowing white cigar-shaped object swooped down over the lake, released three small round objects, and departed. After cavorting about the sky, two of the satellite objects streaked away in opposite directions, and the third advanced eastward toward the witnesses. 


The UFO, a classic ""flying saucer"" with transparent dome and revolving rim of spectral colors and emitting a vibratory hum, halted first about 60ft. (18m) from the dock and then moved to within 10ft. 
(3m). Through the dome ""Michael"" saw two entities with large heads with big oval eyes, two nasal openings, and small mouths. Their short bodies seemed to be clothed in tight-fitting grayish uniforms. The beings communicated with ""Michael"" telepathically, saying that they had come from a distant planet and that he would not be harmed.  Meanwhile, ''Janet"" appeared to be frozen in a trancelike state. 


When ""Michael"" conveyed his curiosity, the disc moved directly overhead. In an effort to confirm that the object was a constructed device, he jumped up to touch the bottom surface. At the top of his jump (without making contact) a brilliant beam of light switched on. ""Michael"" reached for ''Janet"" and fell with her onto the dock. Under the light, he lost consciousness. 


When he became fully aware again, it was totally dark out and he could hear cars arriving and the voices of campers returning from a swim meet. The UFO still hovered overhead. 

From the parking lot on the hill, the scene at the dock would have been at least partially concealed by a bluff, trees, and a pavilion. 


Apparently attracted by the glow of the UFO, two of the swimmers, ""Susan Middleton"" and ""Barbara Bryant,"" ran down to the bluff and cried out. At this point the light from the UFO was extinguished, and ""Michael"" saw it angle upward over the lake and disappear in a matter of seconds. Both witnesses felt abnormally fatigued afterward and fell asleep in their separate quarters. 

While ""Michael"" retained a partial memory of the encounter, ''Janet's"" amnesia was total. Wary of traumatizing her, ""Michael"" decided against discussing the episode with her. As it turned out under later investigation, ''Janet"" wanted desperately to talk with him the day after the event but seemed at a loss to know what it was that she wanted to talk about. Camp closed a few weeks later and the two separated, not to be reunited for another 11 years. 


Ten years passed. Prompted by a number of events over the span of a year, ""Michael"" contacted the Center for UFO Studies, which put him in touch with me (Webb). He and I located ''Janet,"" but, with the exception of a single brief and controlled reunion at Boston's Logan Airport, I kept them apart and interviewed them separately during my five year inquiry.


During separate hypnosis sessions held in the Boston area, ""Michael"" filled in his period of missing time on the dock with an abduction sequence, while ""Janet"" confirmed not only seeing the UFO 
at close range, but also undergoing an onboard experience. Both witnesses recalled being inside the UFO's dimly illuminated interior. Their alien captors were described in similar fashion-large elongated heads, enormous eyes, two nasal apertures, a mouth slit. Two ""guides,"" one for each abductee, kept in constant telepathic contact with their charges throughout the experience. ""Michael's"" description of his abductors was more detailed because 
he apparently remained aware through much of his abduction. He said the humanoids were about 5 ft. (1.5 m) tall and wore greenish, skintight clothing. Their skin color appeared greenish-blue in the dim surroundings of the UFO. ""Janet,"" on the other hand, was told to keep her eyes closed. Thus her impressions were mostly through tactile sensations. Once, however, she peeked at her captors and was so upset by what she saw that she quickly shut her eyes. To her, their skin appeared white, and they all wore smocklike garments. 


""Michael"" declared that as he stood next to his guide, he watched ""Janet's"" body being examined on a table. Two figures used a handheld light to look into her eyes. The skin on her arm was scraped with a pencil-like instrument. A blood sample was taken. At one point a triangular machine descended from the ceiling and appeared to ""suck"" fluids from two body orifices through flexible tubes. When a concerned ""Michael"" asked what they were doing, his guide answered only that they were ""spawning consciousness"" (perhaps an allusion to 
often-reported alien reproductive interests). 


""Janet"" herself recalled the examiners lifting and dropping her arm and inspecting her long hair. Once she felt a heat source on her body and also sensed small devices attached to her head and neck. While the two figures probed ""Janet's"" body, ""Michael"" observed a third entity who monitored a console under a rectangular wall panel 
filled with different screens. The displays seemed to be registering various elements of the exam. ""Janet"" independently confirmed this panel beyond her table, and in fact was the first to mention it. 


Through the dome of the craft ""Michael"" saw the approaching mother craft. He remembered being led to a second table for his own exam, but passed out on the table. When he awoke, the dome overhead was covered as if the disc had entered the larger craft. Accompanied by his guide, he descended through the bottom of the smaller craft into a tube of light extending across a huge hangar-like room in the larger craft. The light beam pulled them to the opposite wall, where they were whisked upward inside to another level. 


After ""Michael"" entered a big domed room seemingly filled with entities and had a helmet-like device placed on his head, everyone looked up at a bubble-shaped screen beyond the captive's view. ""Michael"" had noticed it while entering the room. The entities all appeared to react favorably to whatever was being displayed. His final stop was another room where his guide touched his hands, and immediately the scene dissolved into a strange landscape. 


Ordinary people wandered in a daze through a parklike setting under a purple sky. A crying, frightened ""Janet"" appeared next to him. Then he seemed to fall asleep. Next he found himself falling through space toward a globe covered with TV-like screens, each of which displayed an image of him and ""Janet"" lying on the dock. Passing through one of the screens, he awoke on the dock next to ""Janet."" 


A persistent search turned up the two campers who allegedly had observed the UFO's departure. Both ""Susan"" and ""Barbara"" retained vague memories of an unidentified, dark, circular object with perimeter lights racing away from the waterfront. A potential third witness, playhouse director ""Elaine Thomas,"" recalled an unusual sighting one night during the same week as the primary encounter. A shout about lights in the sky broke up ""Elaine's"" play rehearsal. As she followed behind the running campers to reach a clearing, she detected a silvery glow emanating from some moving source in the sky hidden by trees. By the time she caught up to the others, the glow had receded across the lake and was fading from sight. 


If all the sightings occurred the same evening as the abduction-which could not be substantiated-one can speculate that ""Elaine"" might have observed the UFO's first departure, and ""Susan"" and ""Barbara,"" the UFO's final retreat after returning the abductees.

I believe that certain species once surpass certain certifications/specifications can become “regulators” of other less advanced civilizations, which could be interesting because even if one advanced civilization dies all their culture/knowledge could be shifted on one AI super computer world mind which could display all their previous historical archives to other planetarian civilizations.

A lot of people mentions souls can reincarnate but I’d found that quite odd, maybe us individually after we die we’re send to a quantum archive or some sort of pocket dimension where all still conscious in some way. Also something that could be happening it’s hard and soft reboots of the universe by “quantum engineers”, maybe that explains reincarnation and your soul is in the same body, per say John Lopez of this current reboot was born in California in 1975 while the John Lopez of the previous reboot was born in California but in 1925, same history same family just different execution of the software.

We are talking about things on a cosmic scale and emotional debate adds nothing. 

Here’s an idea of mine that id like some input on. 

I’ve been toying with the theory that locations of intense radioactive electromagnetic energy could potentially work as a catalyst for enhancing the ability to explore your own consciousness. A lot of alien tech is assumed to be operated through combination psychic controls. So my thought is that a location like the uinta
Basin that has a focal point where consistent energy is radiated from underground. That if you were to attempt to use hemi-sync and match your brainwave oscillation to that of the concentrated energy in said location, you could then amplify your subconscious and potentially connect to that energy source under skinwalker ranch.

The whole UFO thing was a joke to you before the minute you learned it was real, and now you’re going through the same arrogant thing with the abduction phenomena.

463,aliens,"This 1975 abduction includes the now well-known ""hitchhiker effect,"" the burnt odor, as well as the removal and replacement of the victim in a moving vehicle.","*Name/Date/Location:* David Stephens, 21, and ""Glen,"" 18; October 27, 1975; Tripp Pond, Maine


*Preliminary:* After hearing an explosion, witnesses drove to a nearby lake at about 2:30 A.M. The car turned *as if of its own accord* onto a road that seemed unusually smooth. A herd of cows lay sleeping on the ground, and no traffic or other moving thing appeared. Two lights rose soundlessly from a corn field and, as they neared, enlarged into a craft. It followed the car for a minute, then shone a brilliant light beam on it; the car skidded sideways and the men lost consciousness. 


*Initial activities:* Under hypnosis Stephens remembered standing outside the car while ""Glen"" remained inside. A humanoid being met Stephens and escorted him to a hospital-like room. 


*Craft/Beings:* The craft was large and cylindrical with many lights of various colors. The beings were about 4 ft. (1.4 m) tall and had large hairless heads, large slanted and unblinking eyes, small noses, and no ears or mouths. Their skin was white and seemed harder than human 
skin. They had four webbed fingers and wore black garments. 


*Onboard features:* Stephens saw two rooms: one was domed with curving walls and a shiny floor, the other (hospital-like) room had gray walls, a shiny floor, and bright lights overhead. The latter had an 
""operating table"" and equipment, felt cool, and had a burnt smell. 


*Onboard activities:* Four beings drew two tubes of blood from Stephens's arm, took trimmings of his hair and nails. He refused to undress and struck one of the beings, who appeared neither hurt nor angry. He then gave in without further resistance and felt no fear as the beings undressed him. While lying on the table, a device scanned his body for *40-45 minutes.* Finally, they gave him an injection in the shoulder (a common point of injection in these cases). 


*Communication:* After the examination Stephens got dressed and communicated with the beings. The original being reassured him that he would not be harmed. They communicated by ""brain waves"" and said that they had observed him for some time, and would meet with him again. They refused to answer questions about themselves. 


*Termination/Return:* After the shoulder injection, they led Stephens back to the first room. He next recalled being back in the car with ""Glen"" driving away from the corn field while the UFO continued to follow them. They stopped the car in a field, its engine and radio dead. The main UFO and two 
additional disks remained in sight, maneuvering until a fog hid them. Around 6:30 A.M. the large UFO seemed to suck up the fog and fly away. The car then became operational again. 


*Aftermath:* When the men arrived home, they felt cold, sore, and lightheaded. They lacked balance and coordination, and their eyes burned and had a notable orange discoloration that persisted for three 
days. Stephens experienced intense thirst and both men slept soundly. Hallucinations and poltergeist-like activity troubled them for the next few days, and a random, stocky man  warned Stephens not to talk about the experience. Under hypnosis, he refused to discuss when or whether the beings said they would return. Investigation began October 28, and hypnosis sessions followed between December 1975 and March 1976.

I grew up in an area where I've seen a lot of weird things. I've seen a 10 foot tall black figure on an ATV trail when it was getting close to nightfall. I've seen 3 lights the size of a country road rotating in a circle in fog above the same village. But this is definitely the strangest and scariest to me.

About 1 1/2 months ago I think I might have gotten abducted. It was about 2-3 AM and I was lying in bed. I fell asleep pretty quick but then my eyes shot open quickly which is pretty off for me to do. I saw this thing standing above me in my living room. It had a Head like an owl with 6 black eyes. When the light from my TV hit its eyes they had a shade of red. It stood at about 8 feet from what I guess. All I remember seeing was its head sadly. It leaned down and got right into my face. I couldn't move at all but I felt fear like I never have before.  My eyes shut and when they opened again I was somewhere else. I was in a white room and I could barely see because of how bright it was. I saw these old computer looking things with red and green lights blinking. My eyes shut again until I woke up the next morning way earlier than normal.

It still scares me and I can't fall asleep without some light on. I'm normally fearless. I don't know what happened and part of me isn't sure if I want to know.

Then I looked into other witness/abductees stories, Bob Lazer & Travis Walton in particular’s stories and within minutes of a quick research into historical accounts how quick I come to the decision it was bullshit.  Information I come by was posted here on Reddit how true those documents are I can’t say, historical reports, etc which I find absolutely absurd how people are so quick to believe! 

I may use sarcasm but seriously when you look into the historic claims, past of these two how can’t anyone question what they are saying? Especially with Travis who with his brother had made 11 claims of alien contact, yet after they hit payday there’s never been a case reported by him and friends. Bob well, I read a report on his E115 and the other shite 🤦‍♀️.

477,aliens,Faith Will Fail You,"
I’ve seen a UFO. This isn’t about whether or not something is happening, because I’ve seen it. Whatever it was, wherever it was from, it was real. But that’s not what this is about. 


People on here say things like: 


*”I wish they’d take me away.”*

“*People see them in dreams!*”

“*Theyve spoken to me. I know it’s real.*”

“*You’re disinformation! Why would so many people lie?*”

“*Do you think they’ll save us? Why aren’t they helping us?”*

Ufology for a lot of people, at least here— is now their faith. It is their belief, through and through. The modern world has engineered atomic weapons, the internet, cures for countless diseases. No one has found God in these innovations, and as the traditional origins of our civilizations shift and change, as all societies do, beliefs change. Old faiths evolve or die, and new ones arise. 

How many of you here are dissatisfied with the world currently? Deeply unhappy? *Afraid*? 

This has all shifted into a way of coping, an intense and vivid fantasy that seeks to both empower of the person within it (you), and to create a grand plan that you will participate within to free yourself from the happiness within and without.  Contactees are spoken directly to by beings who essentially every single imaginable capability to make landmark changes with even the *slightest* of efforts— yet they don’t. Just like angles and guardians in old myths and stories could solve the heroes problems, they don’t, guidance in the form of a miracle or a lesson is relayed, and the story begins. It sounds like fantasy. *It is fantasy*. 

It’s constantly evolving and changing, constantly incorporating new elements. Science-y sounding words like energy, quantum; all of it is invoked in one breath to hold up science as the truth, and in the next, any scientific principle that disagrees with these assumptions is lauded as proof of academias corruption and failure to recognize the ET truth. Magical dimensions are invented, fucking *dreams*, one of the purest moments of fantasy human beings experience, is held up higher than the opinions and lifetimes of experts dedicated to understanding the universe around them. How much obvious misinformation, fiction, speculation, and even downright fabrication is taken as truth? 

It’s poisonous. Ufology has always attracted crowds of faithful unhappy with their lives and their world predicated on the hopeful belief they’ll be rescued. Ashtar and other luminous masters in the Cold War era are essentially, sometimes even literally, messianic figures who will pluck the rightfully faithful from this world and transplant them to utopian places to be saved. 

We fail ourselves and we fail any attempt to truly understand what is occurring when the fantastical overrides the reality. 

An important question to ask yourself to distinguish between a faith and a fact is simple: what would it take to convince you otherwise? What evidence can be shown to dissuade you? If you simply believe something because someone said so, or it makes you feel good— how easy is it for you to simply believe *this*thing or *that thing*? If you believe energy is eternal and our consciousness is linked to essentially magic, that’s wonderful, now, what would change your mind? If you believe UFOs are here to save us and you’re somehow okay with the fact that they seem to and not to interfere when it’s convenient in the story, what would make you convinced of the opposite? 

You want the truth? 

*No one is coming to save you.* 

*No one cares. The cosmos is ancient and vast, and stares back at us unmoving.* 

*There is no Heaven, there is no utopia to run to. This world, even in a cosmos likely full of life, is all humanity will have for a long time.* 

*Whatever is occurring in our skies is real, strange, and unknown. No expert, no talking head, no bookseller, truly understands more than those essential and most basic facts. We must do our due diligence to truly investigate.*

*This Earth is precious and small. We must treasure it, and act on that fact, instead of believing we will be ascended. There is no grand conspiracy, there is no epic design. There is just this life, this world. If we throw it all away on the hope of saviors or on the misery of a fictional Cabal, we lose everything.*",scm6bc,0,,1643140087.0,17,0.42

Notably, this case was apparently *not* recalled through hypnotic regression.","*Name/Date/Location:* Sgt. Charles L. Moody, 30s; August 13, 1975; Alamogordo, New Mexico.


*Preliminary:* Moody, an Air Force noncommissioned officer, had driven into the desert to watch the Perseid meteor shower. As he stood by his car at 1:15 A.M., a luminous object descended with a wob-
bling motion to a low altitude and moved toward him. He tried to start his car, but was unsuccessful. 


*Initial activities:* The object hovered about 70 ft. (21 m) away, emitting a humming sound. The shadowy forms of several beings were visible through a large window. The sound stopped, a numbness came 
over him, and a time lapse followed. About two weeks after the encounter Moody spontaneously recalled what happened. A light engulfed the car, and then the numbness began. Two beings glided toward the car and tried to open the door. The witness swung open the door, striking one of the beings, then he struck the other with his fist. Total paralysis followed. 


*Craft/Beings:* Three rounded structures were visible on underside of craft. Thin humanoids with large heads, no hair, small noses and ears, gray-white skin, large round eyes under a protruding brow. The mouths were small with no lips and never moved. The beings who took Moody on board were about 6ft. (1.8 m) tall, but the apparent leader on board was not quite 5 ft. (1.5 m) tall and wore tight white clothing, whereas the other crewmembers wore skintight black clothing. 


*Onboard features:* White domed room lighted by indirect light, table. Elevator down to ""engine room,"" where Moody saw a large rod and three hemispherical crystalline objects sitting on rods or bars. The room was about 25ft. (7.5 m) across *and seemed too large for the exterior 
appearance of the craft.* The room had ""rafters,"" and a black box that seemed to be a weapon. The air on board had a ""burned-sugar"" smell, and it was difficult to breathe. 


*Onboard activities:* Moody regained consciousness and found himself lying on a table, totally paralyzed. A rodlike device was touched to his back and he recovered his feeling and mobility, and some injuries sustained during the initial struggle seemed to be repaired. The being helped him off the table. At his request, he was given a tour of the room containing the propulsion system and was taken down in an elevator. Afterward they went back up in the elevator. 


*Communication:* When Moody awoke on the table, the being promised him more mobility if he would refrain from further violence. Though stern in appearance, the ""leader"" was gentle and reassuring. He conversed with Moody by telepathy, telling him that they would ""return within three years and make ourselves known to mankind."" 

*He called Moody by his proper name and referred to him as ""my son.""* 


During the ""engine room"" tour the leader told him they came from a mother ship, and that they could be harmed by earth weapons but would defend themselves. Other questions he refused to answer. 
Moody was told that it was time to go and that he should forget the purpose of the black box. He was instructed to forget 
everything for two weeks and to visit a doctor. 


*Termination/Return:* The being placed his hands on Moody's head causing him to lose consciousness. His next memory was of sitting in his car and watching the craft take off and disappear. 


*Aftermath:* Moody reached home at 3:00 A.M. and went to work the next day with a sore back. The condition persisted for a week or more, and a rash appeared on his back. He began to have fragmentary memories, then his full memory returned by October 6, 1975.

480,aliens,Some thoughts on the Control System Theory proposed by Jacques Vallee,"  

Just finished Reading Jacques Vallee book Dimensions, which seems to be a stepping stone on actual UFO research.  In it Jacques Vallee tries to challenge the Ufo- Aliens Spacecraft Theory and proposes an alternate theory of a system of control from other dimensional beings or possibly a new aspect of our consciousness that develops on other dimensions. 

**Summary of**  **Dimensions by Jacques Vallee**

**Some arguments from Jacques Vallee.**  

– ‘’Challenging the Spacecraft Theory

1. Too Many Landings

The first argument against the idea of flying saucers as spacecraft lies, oddly enough, in the large number of verified, unexplained sightings. In my own files I have selected approximately two thousand documented cases of close encounters from every country on earth, many of them involving occupants of various sizes and shapes. It may seem that two thousand cases in some twenty years is not a very large number, but we are talking only about the cases that were actually reported. It is possible to calculate how many landings this represents if, as the contactees claim, UFOs are spacecraft whose occupants happened to be surprised by witnesses who wandered onto the scene as the craft was being repaired or as the crew was conducting some exploration of our planet. To make this estimation we must take into account three factors: the time of the sighting, the probability that it will be reported, and the place of the event. Most landings are reported to take place after 6:00 P.M. The frequency distributions my computer studies have disclosed for every continent show this activity peaking at about 10:30 P.M., decreasing sharply after that time, and increasing again just before dawn. There are few reports after 6:00 A.M. What could this mean? That the activity of the objects is nocturnal by nature and by choice. Then why do the reports decrease in frequency around midnight? Simply because people go to bed: after 10:30 P.M. the number of potential witnesses is severely reduced. Then let us ask how many reports would we have if people did not go to bed but stayed outside to watch these so-called spacecraft. The answer is about thirty thousand. We would have to multiply the number of cases by a factor of fifteen, and the actual peak would then be between 1:00 and 3:00 A.M. Now, this last figure does not begin to approximate the actual number of events, because we know from many independent studies that only one case in ten ever gets reported. Then we should have not thirty thousand but three hundred thousand cases in our files!

But this still isn't the whole story: most landings occur in unpopulated areas, away from dwellings. If the earth's population were distributed evenly instead of being concentrated in city areas, how many reports would we have? Again, taking a conservative multiplying factor of ten leads us to the staggering conclusion that the UFOs, if they are spacecraft engaged in a general survey of our planet, must have landed here no fewer than three million times in two decades!

\[I first reported this finding ten years ago in a paper delivered before the American Institute of Aeronautics and astronautics. This ""law of the times"" has now been verified by other researchers in various countries, and the total number of estimated landings has been repeatedly confirmed.\] This number is totally absurd. Using a single probe the size of a beer keg in orbit a thousand miles above the earth, human technology as it exists today would be able to capture in a few weeks most of the important facts about the planet's geography, weather, vegetation, and culture. Given the earth's abundant emission of radio and television programs for the last fifty years, even the deployment of such a space probe might be unnecessary. This is one of the little-recognized facts of the UFO problem that any theory has yet to explain. The theory of random visitation does not explain it. Either the UFOs select their witnesses for psychological or sociological reasons, or they are something entirely different from space vehicles. In either case, their appearances are staged!

2. The Super Physics of the UFOs

Most witnesses are not primarily reporting an object or a craft; they are reporting a light, a massive, multicolored, intense, pulsating light, a playful, fascinating, impressive, hypnotic light that is accompanied by strange sounds. In other words, UFOs may be unidentified, but they are not flying, as birds and airplanes fly, and they do not always behave as material objects. How much do we know from the avilable scientific literature about the effects of strong, pulsed, colored lights and other electromagnetic radiations, such as microwaves and gamma rays, on the human brain and on the major nerves? Pitifully little. Until this area is fully explored, we will only have a poor understanding of the physics of UFOs.

3. The Absurd Humanoids 

Contactees tell us they have met the denizens of other planets. In some cases the beings turned out to be robots or dwarfs in diving suits, but in most incidents they were humanoid, and they could breathe our air. They walked normally on our planet. In a variety of sightings they were accompanied by human beings. Occasionally, the occupants were completely human and spoke human languages. The same applies to elves and angels, to sylphs and to jinn. However, visitors from outer space would not be human in shape. They would certainly not breathe our air (for fear of viruses, even if they were adapted to the atmosphere's chemical composition). They might have serious problems with the earth's gravity. They would not fit within our culture. We would not recognize the emotions on their faces

***Emerging fully armed into our local universe, the UFOs provide the physical support for our own dreams. We do the rest. Our brains erect a ladder of symbols toward the darkened skies where the strange machines hover, and we meet them more than halfway across the bridge of their strangeness – perhaps because we vaguely percieve that their irresistible, pathetic adventure is closely related to our own. But the extraterrestrial theory is not good enough, because it is not strange enough to explain the facts.’’***   

***Than Jacques Vallee goes on to develop his Theory of*** ***System of Control***

\- ‘’As a society, we are developing a great thirst for contact with superior minds that will provide guidance for our poor, harassed, hectic planet. I think we may be ready to fall into a trap, perhaps a kind, benevolent pitfall. I believe that when we speak of UFO sightings as instances of space visitations we are looking at the phenomenon on the wrong level. We are not dealing with successive waves of visitations from space. We are dealing with a control system. The thermostats that regulate your house temperature summer and winter are an example of a control system. In summer, a thermostat allows the air to get warmer until a certain limit is reached, and then the cooling system is triggered. But in winter, when the outside atmosphere turns cold and the temperature drops below another limit, a different mechanism, the heater, comes into play and warms the house. A naive observer might try to explain all this by assuming that warm is ""good"" and cold is ""bad."" He or she would be right half the time. Another naive observer of the opposite school might take a reversed view and decide that warm is ""evil."" He or she would also be right half the time. To understand the whole phenomenon one needs a grasp of the control concept, and one must be ready to understand that it needs two opposite principles for its function. ***I propose that there is a spiritual control system for human consciousness and that paranormal phenomena like UFOs are one of its manifestations. I cannot tell whether this control is natural and spontaneous; whether it is explainable in terms of genetics, of social psychology, or of ordinary phenomena – or if it is artificial in nature, under the power of some superhuman will. It may be entirely determined by laws that we have not yet discovered. I am led to this idea by the fact that, in every instance of the UFO phenomenon I have been able to study in depth, I have found as many rational elements as absurd ones, as many that I could call friendly as I could call hostile***…..

\- What is the variable being controlled in this control system? Thermostats control temperature; gyroscopes control the direction in which a rocket flies. What could a paranormal phenomenon control? I suggest that it is human belief that is being controlled and conditioned.

\- When I speak of a spiritual control system I do not mean that some higher supercivilization has locked us inside the constrains of a space-bound jail, closely monitored by entities we might call angels or demons. What I do mean is that mythology rules at a level of our social reality over which normal political and intellectual trends have no real power. At that level, time frames are long and evolution is slow. Mass media, which are designed to give split-second images of transient noise (the noisier the better), miss this signal entirely. A society with an attention span of minutes (the interval between two TV commercial breaks) can have no concept of events that began when my grandfather was not yet born and will end after my grandson dies. But there are such long-term changes. They dominate the destiny of civilizations. Myths define the set of things scholars, politicians, and scientists can think about. They are operated upon by symbols, and the language these symbols form consistutes a complete system. This system is metalogical, but not metaphysical. It violates no laws because it is the substance of which laws are made. The theory does not explain how UFOs are made to appear to us, although it gives support to one idea about them: that they are constructed both as physical craft (a fact which has long appeared to me undeniable) and as psychic devices whose exact properties remain to be defined. As a focus for psychic phenomena, the UFO evokes a deep emotional reaction in the viewer, but logical development of an investigation is prevented – or precluded – by the apparent violations of causality that surround it and by the sociological climate that is created. Scientists may be willing to interview witnesses who have seen a landed craft, but they may not wish to talk with the witnesses. Or a witness may offer as ""proof"" of his experience a couple of pancakes given to him by extraterrestrials, or a recitation of meaningless messages, or a story of sexual contact with a being from outer space. Pursuit of the rational study of the case is discouraged. The lurid aspects of many such stories make their serious examination improbable, and this in turn reinforces the role of the rumors as secret folklore, rich in new images.

\- Instead I believe that the UFO phenomenon represents evidence for other dimensions beyond spacetime; the UFOs may not come from ordinary space, but from a multiverse which is all around us, and of which we have stubbornly refused to consider the disturbing reality in spite of the evidence aviable to us for centuries. Such a theory is required in order to explain both the modern cases and the chronicles of Magonia – the abductions and the psychic component I believe there is a system around us that transcends time as it transcends space. Other researchers have reached the same conclusion. Some have come away deeply discouraged by the realization best summed up early in this century by Charles Fort, the author of The Book of the Damned: ""We are property."" Scholars of this phenomenon, like Father Salvatore Freixedo in Latin America, John Keel in the United States, and Aime Michel in France, feel that we may be powerless before the complex and absurd capabilities of an alien intelligence that can masquerade as a Martian invader, as a primitive god, as the Blessed Virgin, as a fleet of airships. While I acknowledge their observations I remain confident that human knowledge is capable of eventually understanding the larger reality the phenomenon represents. We should go on studying it – case after bizarre case, pattern after strange pattern. 

\- The system I am speaking of, a system with mastery of space and time dimensions, may well be able to locate itself in outer space. Nonetheless, its manifestations cannot be spacecraft in the ordinary nuts-and-bolts sense. The UFOs are physical manifestations that simply cannot be understood apart from their psychic and symbolic reality. What we see here is not an alien invasion. It is a spiritual system that acts on humans and uses humans.In attempting to find an adequate research framework, it is useful to speculate about variants of current physics in which apparent miracles could occur without violating physical laws and in which psychic phenomena should be the rule rather than the exception. In such a physics, UFOs could come from earth without necessarily being human inventions, or they could come from another galaxy without necessarily being spacecraft’’   

***My thoughts on the Control System Theory***

His Arguments against aliens spacecraft’s are quite compelling, these seems more like creation of our own imagination than aliens visiting earth but than his theory of parallel dimensional beings  is quite difficult to prove and seems as well far from being true. Im more intrigued by the possibility of these being natural and spontaneous phenomenon of the Human consciousness in these reality not in some other dimensions. This seems more to be a Spontaneous System of Self-control generated by some form of synchronized movement of the masses. 

My theory is that our collective consciousness is  greater than our individual consciousness, our collective consciences its more than the some of its parts. The interaction and synchronized activity maybe on our subconscious level creates electromagnetic waves able to produce different form of lights. 

But what are the possible mechanism  and origin of these Phenomenon ? 

There are some concepts we have to explane 

Self organization - 

[http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/SELFORG.html](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/SELFORG.html) 

‘’Self-organization is a basically a process of [evolution](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/EVOLUT.html) where the effect of the environment is minimal, i.e. where the development of new, complex structures takes place primarily in and through the system itself. As argued in the section on [evolutionary theory](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/EVOLUT.html), self-organization can be understood on the basis of the same variation and natural selection processes as other, environmentally driven processes of evolution. Self-organization is normally triggered by internal variation processes, which are usually called ""fluctuations"" or ""noise"". The fact that these processes produce a selective retained ordered configuration has been called the ""[order from noise](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/ORDNOISE.html)"" principle by [Heinz von Foerster](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/CSTHINK.html#Foerster), and the ""order through fluctuations"" mechanism by Ilya 📷[Prigogine](http://solvayins.ulb.ac.be/generated/IlyaPrigogine.html)

All the intricacies (limit cycles, [chaos](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/CHAOS.html), sensitivity to initial conditions, dissipative structuration, ...) associated with non-linearity can simply be understood through the interplay of positive and negative [feedback](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/FEEDBACK.html) cycles: some variations tend to reinforce themselves (see [Autocatalytic Growth](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/AUTOCAT.html)), others tend to reduce themselves. Both types of feedback *fuel* natural selection: positive feedback because it increases the number of configurations (up to the point where resources become insufficient), negative feedback because it stabilizes configurations.’’

Explained simply-  Entropy causes new characteristics of the system to emerge , if these characteristics are  useful in our survival we retain them if not they disappear. To have a complex phenomenon you don’t need a very difficult explanations. From the Theory of Cellular Automata we can prove in a sense that from simple rules and structures we can produce greater variety of unexpected behaviours. 

([https://mathworld.wolfram.com/CellularAutomaton.html#:\~:text=A%20cellular%20automaton%20is%20a,many%20time%20steps%20as%20desired](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/CellularAutomaton.html#:~:text=A%20cellular%20automaton%20is%20a,many%20time%20steps%20as%20desired).) 

These means that its sufficient theoretically for our human bodies to have some form of simple synchronisation to produce very complicated forms of behaviour. 

It has been scientifically proven that humans do synchronise with each other, we synchronise our movements , heart rates, brains  ect. (

[https://thehill.com/changing-america/well-being/medical-advances/572830-heart-rates-sync-up-when-listening-attentively#:\~:text=People's%20heart%20rates%20and%20breathing,paying%20attention%20to%20the%20action](https://thehill.com/changing-america/well-being/medical-advances/572830-heart-rates-sync-up-when-listening-attentively#:~:text=People's%20heart%20rates%20and%20breathing,paying%20attention%20to%20the%20action).

[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-65670-1](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-65670-1) 

[https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/hyperscans-show-how-brains-sync-as-people-interact/](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/hyperscans-show-how-brains-sync-as-people-interact/) ) 

In nature we have other forms of collective movements caused and explained from basic principles like Bird Flocks ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flock\_(birds))](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flock_(birds))) , Fish Schooling ect. ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoaling\_and\_schooling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoaling_and_schooling)) 

The second concept important to explain is the Ideomotor Phenomenon 

\- Ideomotor phenomenon 

“’The **ideomotor phenomenon** is a [psychological](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological) phenomenon wherein a subject makes motions [unconsciously](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconscious_mind). Also called **ideomotor response** (or **ideomotor reflex**) and abbreviated to **IMR**, it is a concept in [hypnosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypnosis) and psychological research.[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideomotor_phenomenon#cite_note-2) It is derived from the terms ""[ideo](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/ideo)"" (idea, or [mental representation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_representation)) and ""[motor](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/motor)"" (muscular action). The phrase is most commonly used in reference to the process whereby a thought or mental image brings about a seemingly ""reflexive"" or automatic [muscular](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscular) reaction, often of minuscule degree, and potentially outside of the awareness of the subject. As in reflexive responses to pain, the body sometimes reacts reflexively with an **ideomotor effect** to ideas alone without the person consciously deciding to take action. The effects of [automatic writing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_writing), [dowsing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dowsing), [facilitated communication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facilitated_communication),[\[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideomotor_phenomenon#cite_note-3) [applied kinesiology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applied_kinesiology) and [Ouija boards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ouija) have been attributed to the phenomenon.[\[4\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideomotor_phenomenon#cite_note-4)[\[5\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideomotor_phenomenon#cite_note-5)’’ 

One of the effect of the ideomotor pheonomenon is the Charlie Charlie challenge  

( [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie\_Charlie\_challenge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Charlie_challenge) )  ‘’Psychological [suggestion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suggestion) can lead people to expect a particular response, which can result in thoughts and behaviors that will help bring the anticipated outcome to fruition – for instance by breathing more heavily.’’ 

My speculation is that there is some unknown mechanism where we the people make very simple synchronisation of our bodily functions ( possible radiant heat or some other forms and waves emantes from our body in a synchronized form)  caused by some from of ideomotor phenomenon, by some form of self hypnosis. These synchronised electromagnetic waves are in fact In control of these incomprehensible light that communicates with us in forms of ufos, virgin Mary ect.",scez2i,39,,1643120836.0,14,0.93

These photographs have been around the internet since the early 00's. No one seems to know where they origined from, but here's what I found.

[According to this website](https://shortcuttoaliens.tripod.com/id7.html), ""Mr XXXX"" was woken in the night and saw a triangular UFO, grabbed his video camera and filmed it for 4 minutes. After hearing a strange noise in his garden, he filmed the aliens. This website dates back as early as [2004](https://web.archive.org/web/20040522203351/http://shortcuttoaliens.tripod.com:80/id7.html).

[Rense.com](https://rense.com/general39/fake.htm) claims that it took place in Italy.

>From Italy ([www.sentistoria.it](http://www.sentistoria.it)) comes some fairly impressive, but nonetheless clearly hoaxed ""Greys in the Garden"" shots, said to have been shot with an infrared camera/lens.

[In this video](https://youtu.be/xgqD23zO69Q?t=368) Jaime Maussan claims that the photos were taken in Italy, early July 2003. Curiously, [Sentistoria.it](https://web.archive.org/web/20030723113451/http://www.sentistoria.it:80/) has been down since July 2003.

[In another video](https://youtu.be/3jlJgo3Ry-c?t=78), Maussan contradicts himself by saying that they come from England, late 1999. He claims some guys working in British government computers leaked it to the internet in 2001. Looks like there's another photograph of one of the aliens.

The Berwyn 1974 incident was one of the major UFO encounters to come out of the United Kingdom. 

On 20 January many eyewitnesses claimed they had seen heard an explosion, felt the ground shake and seen a bright shaped large object at the top of the Berwyn Mountain range in North Wales. 

This was followed up by an apparent retired military employee claiming he had witnessed alien bodies being removed from boxes at Porton Down, a research facility in the UK. 

It's hard to discredit the eyewitnesses on the UFO, but it is also difficult to just take the word of the apparent military officer who claimed to see alien bodies, of which we still don't know his name.

489,aliens,"This abduction case from 1974 illustrates absurdity, symbiosis, disbodiment and an early recounting of the now well-known hitchhiker effect:","*Name/Date/Location:* John Day, 32, Sue Day, 28 (""John and Elaine Avis"") and their three children; October 27, 1974; Aveley, Essex, UK. 


*Preliminary:* Family left at 9:50 P.M. for 20-minute drive home. An oval light maneuvered overhead and disappeared. The car radio crackled and smoked, and the car entered a dense bank of green ""fog"" that was luminous, cold, and silent. They lost conscious memory.


*Initial activities:* The parents had only spotty memory of what happened inside the ""fog."" A white shaft of light shone through the ""fog"" and struck the car, which then was lifted upward into a craft. Both remember standing on a balcony and looking down on a car and some people, and *both felt they were looking at themselves.* Some beings took them to an examination room. 


*Craft/Beings:* Large oval craft with three levels on the interior. Two kinds of beings. One kind was over 6ft. (1.8 m) tall and humanoid, with pink eyes, no visible nose or mouth (perhaps concealed), pale skin, and no hair. They had three fingers and apparently jointless limbs. They wore coveralls that covered their hands and formed a hood over their heads. Outside the craft they wore helmets with visors. They walked with short, graceful steps as they escorted the family around, and seemed to be in charge. One who was about 2 in. (5 cm) taller than the others seemed to be the leader. He also wore a belt. The other beings were about 4 ft. (1.2 m) tall humanoids with bat-like or owl-like faces, large slanted eyes, and large pointed ears. The mouth was a slit, the nose beak-like. The hands had four clawlike digits. The beings had short fur on all exposed portions of their bodies. They 
moved awkwardly and served solely as examiners. When the tall beings approached, the short ones stepped back. They made humming and chirping sounds. 


*Onboard features:* At the bottom of the craft was a large, oval hangar-like room with girders visible on the walls. The middle level contained the examination room and other functional rooms, each oval and connected by tunnels, and the propulsion system, part of which was a blue sphere. The upper level was the control room, oval, about 30ft. by 40ft. (9 m by 12m). The examination room had tables, and various instruments including a square grid on an arm that descended from the ceiling. There was also a corridor; a ""lounge""; a ""laboratory""; tunnels; an apparent bedroom; an elevator-like tube that led to a control room; a couch, pictures flashing on a screen, including star maps. The rooms were uniformly illuminated by a light source in the walls. Doors opened out of seemingly solid walls. 


*Onboard activities:* John woke up lying paralyzed on a table. The overhead device descended and seemed to scan his body, giving him a warm and tingling sensation. Some taller beings stood off to the side 
as two small beings examined him with a penlike instrument. Sue found herself strapped to a table where she was examined by two small beings using penlike instruments and making humming sounds as they worked. John and Sue were given separate tours of the craft, moving through various corridors and tunnels. In one room John reclined on a couch and watched pictures and star maps flashing rapidly on a screen. In another room he was shown what looked like a hologram showing the destruction of earth through misuse. Sue was shown the control room and also saw a screen displaying the solar 
system and earth, and many pictures and maps in rapid succession. Both were shown, and touched, a glowing sphere that seemed very important to the beings. 


*Communication:* The leader communicated with them via telepathy. He gave extensive answers to questions. At one point he had another being play relaxing music for Sue, explaining that this person's talent was music. He told her that her children were safe. He said that they 
had no children, reproducing instead through human beings. He told her that the examiners were more afraid of her than she was of them. When John complained that the pictures on the screen were moving 
too fast, the leader assured him that he would remember them all. He explained the propulsion system to them. A blue sphere was part of the ""ion drive"" system. Within the earth's atmosphere they used a 
magnetic drive, which also provided a weapon and gave the craft ""stealth"" capability, causing it to become invisible. He said they had bases under the sea and used ley lines for navigation. He hinted at a symbiotic relationship between them and humans, and that humans were their children. At the conclusion of the encounter he told them it was time to go, but said they would meet again. 


*Termination/Return:* Both lost consciousness, but Sue retained partial 
memories of being escorted back to the car in the hangar-like area. They partially regained consciousness in the car, which shuddered and began moving. Both felt a jolt, the ""fog"" was gone, and they became fully conscious driving along in the car, which was operating normally. They arrived home at 1:00 A.M., a little over three hours 
later than expected. 


*Aftermath:* Dreams began to reveal the missing time, and further details came out under questioning during interviews. Only John underwent hypnosis with Sue as an observer. He recalled a former life and the missing three hours. His recall triggered Sue's so she was able to describe her onboard experiences without hypnosis. The car malfunctioned, and within a few months broke down completely. Three different cars followed them for several months, and John experienced some peculiar ""police"" harassment. They experienced poltergeist activity, objects levitating and crashing, peculiar sights and sounds. John and Sue both underwent major personality changes.
john had a nervous breakdown two months after the encounter and did not work until the following September. He changed to more satisfying jobs and began writing poetry. Sue went to college. They gave 
up meat, tobacco, and alcohol.

1: The physical/mental safety of all those involved must always take centre stage. 


2: Hypnotism/regression should be avoided due to risks involving trauma/psychic driving. This is regarding parties other than myself, as I'm in no way trained. This is with regards to hypnotism taking place during my research. 


3: A system of gathering validly on the alleged abductee's behalf (to some extent) must be designed. Validity, here, means avoiding trolls where possible. 


4: There must exist a way for abductees to reach out that spans a wider group of individuals than the /aliens community alone.

I'm here to tell you that I don't think there are aliens interacting with our world in a deliberate manner, but rather that every single (legitimate) UFO sighting is completely unique, unintended, and unconnected from all other UFO phenomena. Let me tell you why. 

The only presumption you need to agree with me on for this to be rational is:

**1)** At least one alien civilization has developed light speed in the known universe.

I looked up information about time dilation while I was watching this documentary about the Event Horizon Telescope. I came across this article titled ""How does time stop?"" from the University of Southern Maine. It takes Einstein's theory of Special Relativity and makes interesting observations. Here is the bombshell that is relevant for this post,

&#x200B;

>Time dilates on moving vessels: the greater the speed, the greater the time dilation. Only when such velocities\* approach light speed do such effects become significant. If, and this one of those extreme IF's, a vessel could attain light speed, time aboard the vessel would cease altogether. Any person on that vessel would experience nothing at all.

&

>Let's say, to play with this fantasy world a bit, that a vessel moves at light speed from now (2014) to 2214. For us, two hundreds years would elapse. No time would pass at all on the vessel. What would be two centuries on Earth would be instantaneous on the ship.

&#x200B;

To sum: light speed travel is instantaneous to the passenger regardless of distance, because time effectively stops. If one had enough theoretic ""fuel"" and traveled in an unobstructed path, they could arrive at the heat death of the universe just as quickly as they would traveling a few light years away: *at the blink of an eye.*

If an alien civilization gained the ability to FTL travel in the year 2020, then they would effectively be present at every point of time, *for all of time,* ***at the same time,*** going forward from 2020***.*** Imagine how these kinds of aliens would interact with Earth. I think that we traditionally envision extraterrestrials as one group that is exerting their influence over the planet. What I think might be more likely is that Earth is an attractive pitstop in the long-distance voyages of alien civilizations or individuals. 

Think of how different an alien may observe life under these circumstances - where you can go anywhere in the universe, but each stop you make is hundreds of thousands of years apart. What's a threat, anymore? What's an Empire if you never have to be around for it? What's property, or possession? What's a ""civilization""? Why care about a planet called Earth? We think of groups in a permanent sense, but if you can transcend time forwardly, then permanence is an afterthought.

I think this explains several trends we experience with UFOs:

A)  **Withheld Interference -** Self explanatory from above.

B) **Lack of continuity/explanation -** If any one FTL vessel can traverse the universe in an instant (theoretically of course), then any civilization with FTL can arrive to Earth from varying time periods. Lost travelers, wayward soldiers, and exploring civilizations both good or bad could come across our little blue ball. It could explain why we see saucers, pills, triangles, and all sorts of varying aircraft. It's why some aliens are friendly, some probe you, and others kill in horrific ways: they're not the same folks. 

C) **Government confusion** \- If the above statement is true, then it is an utterly terrifying situation to behold at the government level. How can you make sense of being caught in a galactic jet stream of alien travelers, each hailing from every epoch of time? How that revelation can make you feel so insignificant, small, and helpless? Furthermore, if every piece of recovered alien tech (crash landings or whatnot) each hails from a different civilization, then there is no way to discover patterns and actually ascertain the technology.",sbf568,27,,1643004662.0,10,0.83

499,aliens,I saw something in the sky,"My story goes back to 2014 or 2015 but is still extremely clear in my mind. I have never seen reports that dealt with the same kind of objects I observed.

I was driving home and for no particular reason took a look at the sky. What I saw forced me to pull over and get out of my car: two objects, one seemed like a perfect metal sphere, the other one a gray disc.

They were flying really low (hard to tell but I'd guess 100 meters or so) and slowly, I had plenty of time to watch. They kept a few meters apart from each other, very precisely, travelling at the exact same speed; I actually thought it could be one single object with an invisible beam connecting its two parts. The sphere didn't appear to be rotating but the disc was clearly wobbling. Also it didn't look like your classic flying saucer, it was flatter and without any dome in the middle. The feeling wasn't one of potential harm, in fact they seemed pretty ""neutral"", but I had a strong sense of extraterrestrial-ness. It was just... surreal.

I'm an aerospace engineer and 100% positive that those things CANNOT fly with the propulsion systems we know, not with those shapes, not at that speed. They didn't seem to be ejecting anything either.

While recalling this encounter I have goosebumps and tears fill my eyes, years later. Sounds like a lazy excuse but I was so shocked that I didn't even think of filming or taking pictures with my phone. I am somewhat grateful I got to witness something that extraordinary but I would really, REALLY like to know what those things were.",sb32rz,70,,1642969883.0,15,0.89
500,aliens,This abduction case from 1974 might be the inspiration for the movie The Matrix,"*Name/Date/Location:* Carl Higdon, 40; October 25, 1974; Rawlins, Wyoming 


*Preliminary:* While hunting in Medicine Bow National Forest, Higdon entered an area where he heard no animals but saw five motionless elk. He shot at the bull elk, but the bullet dropped to the ground about 50 ft. away as if it had struck a wall. 


*Initial activities:* A twig snapped and Higdon saw a human-like being about 6ft. 2 in. tall standing in the shade of a tree. The man spoke, barely moving his lips, and said his name was ""Ausso."" He offered Higdon a package of four capsules supposed to be food pills. Higdon swallowed them without resistance, and then agreed to go with ""Ausso."" The being pointed his arm and Higdon found himself on board a craft. 


*Craft/Beings:* The being's face appeared chinless and he had only three teeth each in his upper and lower jaws, a flat nose, no visible ears, thin bristling hair on top. He was bow-legged and no hands were visible. His right arm ended in a cone-shaped device that Higdon took to be a gun. The being wore a black coverall, black shoes, belts across his chest and another around the waist, which had a starlike emblem as a buckle and a small apron-like flap underneath. He never allowed Higdon to come too near him or to see him from the side or rear. 


*Onboard features:* Transparent cubicle, four seats, a control panel, a mirror, and a symbol thought to be a map of some kind. The five elk stood frozen in a cage behind him and another being like ""Ausso"" was in the small room, estimated 5 ft. by 7 ft. and 7 ft. high. 


*Onboard activities:* Higdon found himself with a helmet on his head, strapped to a chair in a cubicle. When ""Ausso"" pointed his arm at the controls, the cubicle began to move and Higdon saw the earth as a round ball. The cubicle landed almost instantaneously on another planet. It was dark, and they landed near a tower with a flashing light so brilliant that it hurt Higdon's eyes. The tower was conical, like a Christmas tree, about 100ft. tall and made a buzzing sound. 


*Otherworldly environment:* A plaza surrounded the tower, and five human-like beings (a middle-aged man, a young girl, two teenage girls, and a teenage boy) were standing conversing, apparently unaffected by the blinding light. The second being disappeared when they landed. ""Ausso"" floated out with Higdon into the tower and up an elevator. They entered a room where Higdon stood on a platform while a shieldlike device moved out of the wall, positioned itself in front of him for several minutes, then retracted into the wall. 


*Communication:* The being identified himself as ""Ausso,"" apparently communicated to Higdon that the capsules were food and instructed him to ingest them. In the otherworldly environment, after the device appeared to examine him, Higdon was told that he was not what they 
needed and that they would take him back. At various times during the encounter, Higdon was told that they came 163,000 ""light miles"" using gravity/levitation propulsion to explore the earth and find animals to breed for food. ""Ausso"" spoke of a different sun, and seas on their planet that were inadequate for supporting life. While on earth ""Ausso"" avoided direct sunlight because of potential sunburn damage. 


*Termination/Return:* After the examination, they reentered the cubicle 
and ""Ausso"" returned Higdon's rifle. He also pointed his cone-hand-gun and floated the package of capsules out of Higdon's pocket. Higdon next found himself standing on a rocky slope back in Wyoming. He fell and injured himself before finding his truck in a place some distance from where he had left it, and in terrain too rough for him to drive out of. It was 6:00 to 6:30 P.M.; a rescue party found him at 11:30 P.M. 


*Aftermath:* Higdon was confused and disoriented, barely able to recognize his wife or where he was. He was very sensitive to touch and light. His eyes were red and watery, and he had no appetite. He was 
hospitalized at 2:30 A.M., on October 26. The following morning he had a ravenous appetite. While in the hospital he began relating his experience. For a while he had a problem with equilibrium. Later his tuberculosis scars were no longer visible on X-rays and he no longer suffered from kidney stones. Higdon speculated that he was rejected either because he was too old or his vasectomy had made him unsuitable.

Herbert Schirmer; December 3, 1967; Ashland, Nebraska. At about 2:30 A.M., while patrolling in police cruiser, saw red flashing lights ahead, investigated and encountered an object with portholes hovering just above the ground. The object rose and shot out of sight. When Schirmer returned to the police station at about 3:00 A.M., he realized that he could not account for 20 minutes.

Elliptical craft like polished aluminum encircled by oval portholes with red, flashing lights visible through them, tripod legs. Around its periphery was what looked like a catwalk. Beings were 4 to 5 ft. (1.4 to 1.5 m) tall, thin, with long heads, long flat noses, slit mouths, and catlike sunken eyes that did not blink. Gray-white skin, uniforms with boots, gloves, and head coverings. ***They had what looked like a small antenna on the left side of the head and an Emblem like a winged serpent visible on the left breast of the uniform.***

You would not go up to an educated scientist and say “no that is not true” while at the same time not knowing anything about the specific scientific field? Right??? Unless you’re religious or in denial.

509,aliens,Sufficient Evidence to prove off-world UFOs and Aliens are on Earth,"Here is a walkthrough of how to prove to yourself that UFOs and Aliens are on Earth:

**First**, 2004 Nimitz Tic-Tac incident needs to be fully researched.  There is plenty of information widely available on this topic.  The Nimitz incident is the evidence that Tic-Tac UFOs are real.

**Second**, understand the *1964 Twin UFO landings of Socorro, NM and La Madera, NM* (another Tic-Tac UFO shape).  Only 35 hours after the Socorro landing, the second landing in La Madera was covered up by the Air Force.  The first landing in Socorro was definitely not a hoax, i.e. ZERO evidence supports the hoax theories.

**Third**, alien occupants were inside the 1964 New Mexico UFOs during the landing incidents.

The second UFO landing in La Madera was covered up and this FBI memo describes the same landing scene as the Socorro landing just 35 hours earlier.  Unfortunately, we will not know the exact details of the La Madera landing, because of the Air Force coverup.

[La Madera, NM - Same landing pad marks and \\""footprints\\""](https://preview.redd.it/66o08ujn1bd81.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a60ff1f20c6e5cfeb1f0386940606450e6fc0b3d)

You can see the official Air Force cover story for La Madera was a dump fire and a drunk witness:

This diagram of the Socorro-Zamora UFO landing site seems like a random placement for the landing pads, but when you notice the 90 degree intersection of the quadrangle shape, maybe it isn't so random...

If you intersect the midpoint of the sides with a circle, then you see that the balanced weight of the craft that was being supported.  The center of the circle lines up with the central burn mark that appear to be a straight-up and straight-down burn versus the other burns that had indications of horizonal movement:

The burn marks on ground failed to show chemical propellant of a conventional aircraft or any other foreign material in the soil:

This is the Socorro landing site and Lonnie Zamora's immediate report with regards to the two alien beings that occupied the UFO and left footprints on the ground:

There were other other witnesses to the UFO landing and takeoff, which does not help the hoax theories, i.e. something just fooling Lonnie Zamora.  Also, why would you perform the same hoax in the middle of a field in La Madera, NM only 35 hours later?

[Dubuque Iowa Witnesses and 3 callers into police dispatch](https://preview.redd.it/j9e4u0d64bd81.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5f1754d17f0d06f92a2615701c34593debededde)

Many of the debunking theories tie themselves to the DECOY UFO symbol that was given to the public:

For example, the moon lander type of theories do not match the landing site markings, and they attach themselves to ""Hughes Aircraft"" symbols using the DECOY UFO symbol.  Again, why would the moon lander be in La Madera, NM only 30 hours later?

With that said, it's not hard to see two different intelligent species on opposite sides of the same planet with the same level of resources, advance at different paces, hell even the same species but two different civilizations.

524,aliens,"Unexplainable experience in Rangely, CO","SUMMARY AT THE BOTTOM.

To start this off, I want to note that I havent done very much research into what this could potentially be, but nothing that I know of as a 17 year old can explain what happened to me and my aunt over the course of a day.

Context: I was living with my aunt (27) in a very small town. She's still a child in a way, she's never really had a job and she still lives with her mom (my grandma), who was in Oklahoma because we were in the process of moving. My own parents were in Wisconsin and I was in Colorado to obtain my GED.

So it was a very warm summer day, and it was seemingly very slow as well. There wasn't much to do in the small town, and all outdoor activity had been played out that entire week. Anyways, her and I are sitting in the livingroom around 10-ish, talking, drinking coffee, being kinda lazy, when she brings up the idea to watch a movie. We watched two movies that day, the first one was a horror movie, although I forget what it was called, and the second one was older. ""A fire in the sky"" or something close to that. It might have been around 1 or 2 when we got to the second movie. So we're watching the movie, and there's nothing unusual going on, just a classic alien movie that I thought was pretty cool. Then things start getting weird.

15 minutes before the end of the movie, she pauses it, wanting to take a break as we had been sitting in one spot pretty much all day, and at this point it might have been 3 or 4? I'm unsure, but I do know the sun was just setting, so it may have even been later. I took the chance to go to the bathroom as I had drank a gallon of water and needed to pee badly. She got tea and went outside to sit on the front porch. This was a normal thing we would do because the sunsets and nature and neighborhood was so beautiful. Normally we'll have our phones and whatever else, but this time both of our phones were dead, and charging inside the house. I went outside and sat on the other side of the deck. It was 10 feet wide so there was quite a bit of space between us, meaning the perspectives were slight in differences.

So I'm sitting out there, enjoying the warm air, watching the neighbors play and our other neighbors cook outside. It felt nice... But also strange. As if I was outside of time itself. The sky was mesmerizing. The air was thick and still. It almost felt as if I smoked weed, but not quite... It was weird considering I hadn't done anything like that for at least 6 months. Just as I'm lost in thought, my aunt turns to me and says ""the atmosphere out here is so weird!"" she said in a loud whisper because of the neighbors. Then my body starts to shiver with excitement, I turn to her and tell her that I felt the same. We start freaking out together in very childish ways and we become obnoxious. The neighbors don't usually mind, but there was this girl (16) out who was very friendly with us and fairly social just across the street. Today, she didnt seem to pay us any attention. Me and my aunt keep to ourselves as well, pointing out what could be causing this strange atmosphere. At first we think it could be the water, then the air, then maybe that we've been watching movies for like 8 hours. I forget exactly what sparked it, but we focused our attention on the birds flying from behind our house, to the front. One by one by one. We're laughing, and in my mind there is no way we arent high... and as the third and final bird passes, we're greeted with what looks like a 2nd sun. Appearing from thin air right behind the bird... I didnt exactly see it appear, because the bird flew in my view of it, but to my aunt, the bird was flying under it. She said it came out if nowhere. It was high in the sky as well, in a sky with zero cloud cover. A sun that was the size of a moon. At this time we had been acting strange for what might have been 30-45 minutes, and not one neighbor looked at us or directed their attention to the large object in the sky. My aunt and I are pointing and screaming and exclaiming for the 10 seconds it was large in the sky, then it peaked, and began to shrink and move towards the sunset slowly until it shrunk into the atmosphere. Not one other person who was out there looked. Me and my aunt. That's it. We went back inside later after the eventful evening and finished the movie.

The best way to describe what we saw would be to call it ""A ball of fire in the sky."" If anyone can shed some light on what this might have been, I'd love an answer. I've got more stories as well if this one does well.

SUMMARY
Me and my aunt watched an alien movie, then we went outside and saw a fire in the sky, a sun the size of a full moon, maybe a little bigger... I encourage you to read the whole thing, I know its long, but I spent a lot of time on it. I'm no writer, but I think every detail helps.",s9t6ry,3,,1642822866.0,7,0.64
525,aliens,A somewhat obscure police officer's abduction event happened in 1967. It included a discussion about hidden alien bases under the oceans:,"*Name/Date/Location:* Herbert Schirmer; December 3, 1967; Ashland, Nebraska


*Preliminary:* At about 2:30 A.M., while patrolling in police cruiser, saw red flashing lights ahead, investigated and encountered an object with portholes hovering just above the ground. The object rose and shot out of sight. When Schirmer returned to the police station at about 3:00 A.M., he realized that he could not account for 20 minutes.


*Initial activities:* Under hypnosis Schirmer recalled his car radio, lights, and engine failing as the craft moved to a nearby field and landed. A group of humanoid beings approached the car and mentally prevented his fleeing or drawing his revolver. One sprayed greenish gas on the car while another shone a bright light on him. He felt paralyzed and passed out. 


*Craft/Beings:* Elliptical craft like polished aluminum encircled by oval portholes with red, flashing lights visible through them, tripod legs. Around its periphery was what looked like a catwalk. Beings were 4 to 5 ft. (1.4 to 1.5 m) tall, thin, with long heads, long flat noses, slit mouths, and catlike sunken eyes that did not blink. Gray-white skin, uniforms with boots, gloves, and head coverings. They had what looked like a small antenna on the left side of the head and an Emblem like a winged serpent visible on the left breast of the uniform. 


*Onboard features:* Schirmer woke up and was escorted up a ladder and onboard the craft. It was cold. On the first level were large drums in a big circle with black cables connecting them. They showed him the engine overhead, which was like half a cocoon, spinning, giving off bright colors like a rainbow. On the next level up was a room with chairs, a control panel, a map on the wall, and a viewing screen. The map showed a sun and six planets. 


*Onboard activities:* The leader demonstrated a device like a tape player that seemed to transfer information into Schirmer's mind as they interacted. On a screen he was shown beings standing guard outside the craft, other craft flying against a background of stars, and a 
mother ship out in space. 


*Communication:* The leader spoke in broken English with a voice that seemed to come from deep inside. He said they came from another galaxy and showed Schirmer the star map. They were observing us and had been for a long time. They had bases in our solar system, beneath the sea and in the polar regions. They take electricity. The craft used an electromagnetic propulsion system (he called it ""reversible electrical magnetism"") that was vulnerable to radar, and they drew electricity from power lines and energy from water to power both the 
craft and a protective force field. They were contacting us to pave the way for eventual open contact and to prevent us from destroying the earth. 


*Termination/Return:* Schirmer was instructed to forget the experience and was led back outside. He returned to his patrol car and watched the craft take off.


*Aftermath:* Later that night he felt sick, weak, and nervous. He found a red welt on his neck, experienced chronic buzzing in his ears, and had trouble sleeping. He was promoted to chief of police, but later resigned from police work because his obsessive concern about the meaning of his UFO experience interfered with his concentration.

526,aliens,"Chris Bledsoe, Timothy Taylor & the Mother Goddess: When UFO's are no longer just about Aliens.","Where to start with Chris, his encounters are nothing short of incredible, some have even gone so far to say that they have been something 'biblical'.

What draws most attention to Chris is his encounters with 'The Lady', some kind of Mother Goddess. This female being, or deity even, has been around for a very long time, since ""before creation"" in Chris's words during one of his regressions. It shouldn't be lost on people that Professor Diana Pasulka was introduced to Tyler D. (Timothy Taylor) through Chris Bledsoe, as Tim and other NASA, Military and Government officers were attending Chris's property to study the phenomena---basically his encounters are real, get over it, and if it's too much to believe that then stop reading here.

Chris's encounters with 'The Lady' are difficult to understand, in a field which is near impossible to make headway. Like the bull which appeared alongside her, and which charged at Chris and went straight through him as if it was made of light. This association with a bull and mother goddess goes back to the oldest known village mankind ever built, at catalhoyuk in modern turkey, where archaeologists have discovered a mass of bull and female figurines ([see here](https://www.amazon.com/Goddess-Bull-Catalhoyuk-Archaeological-Civilization/dp/1598740695)). There are also myths from native north American peoples of ""white buffalo lady"". There are the obvious similarities to ancient Greek, Hindu and Egyptian cultures, for example the myth of where Zeus turns into a bull and carries Europa on his back through the sky. The Egyptian connection is most fascinating, though, as 'The Lady' referred to herself when talking to Chris, as ""Hathor"", the ancient Egyptian Goddess who was associated with a bull and is often depicted with cows ears and bulls horns ([see here](https://www.amazon.com/Hathor-History-Egyptian-Symbolic-Pharaohs/dp/B07P9CKQQ1/ref=sr_1_4?crid=2Q09F36O2NRI8&amp;amp;keywords=hathor+goddess&amp;amp;qid=1642816479&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;sprefix=hathor+godde%2Cstripbooks-intl-ship%2C507&amp;amp;sr=1-4)). She also told Chris that ""the hidden one is Amun-Ra"", the ancient Egyptian god figure, with Amun representing the hidden form of Ra, and Ra is associated with the Sun and materiality in general. What are we supposed to make of these encounters, is there a precedent? Well, yes, in fact most ancient religions on Earth have been created when a Human encounters a being like 'The Lady'. The experience will be interpreted through the eyes of the culture in which the witness exists in, and it will almost always be interpreted as a sacred or divine encounter. In the case of Fatima, the children, and essentially everyone else at the time, interpreted the being as Mary the mother of Jesus, but she never called herself Mary, it was because Portugal was an extremely catholic country that the children interpreted her as such. Timothy Taylor told Chris Bledsoe (as relayed by Ryan Bledsoe) that he believed him about The Lady, and in fact Tim and his colleagues revered here and that they know she exists, she was the same being that came at Fatima and throughout history, they just don't know how to contact her or what she wants, or who she is. Timothy Taylor also told Chris that his boss (Taylors) is a gentleman known as ""The Hammer, and he works for God"". When Chris was 'abducted' at cape river, the beings that took Chris into their 'craft' told him they were from another universe, so is Aliens the right word? These are the same beings that Chris's oldest son, Chris junior, saw at Cape River also, but he is yet to go on the record about his encounter. Lastly, these are also the same beings that took Chris in some form of bubble that travelled through the cosmos to some form of planet where he encountered The Lady, The Mother...this was a sacred event. These beings are divine, and Chris refers to them as ""angels"" similar to how the children at Fatima called 'The Lady' ""Mary"". So next UFO you see, may not be ET species from Alpha Centaur, but may be interdimensional light beings from another Universe, who, in their words told Chris that they ""work for Creation"". 

It's been stated that Chris was AATIP's first case. But with all the confusion surrounding AATIP and AAWSAP, I'll just leave this factoid here for others to pursue. The family has been studied by high ranking NASA, Military and Government officials. Timothy Taylor has even bought debris from extraterrestrial technology that has been recovered to the Bledsoe family and made them all hold some and they all recorded having an electrical shock from it, which apparently doesn't happen to everyone and has tentatively been associated with something in their genes and thus the ability to produce a certain consciousness dynamic that would allow them to power a UAP craft, similar to how the ET's use their consciousness to drive their space-time ships. We get a lot of information from Ryan who is an amazing fella, and now runs his own podcast channel called 'Bledsoe said so'.

According to Ryan Bledsoe, the government interacting with the family has ben super weird, especially from the CIA types (Jim Semivan...a very slippery gentleman). For example, Ryan has relayed how Jim Semivan and his wife were stalking the youngest Bledsoe sister whilst she was living in New York. Why would he do this? We don't know, but some have speculated that by being in contact with the Bledsoe's (or similar folks), will increase your chances of encountering the phenomena. Semivan completely disregarded common decency and privacy in regards to his conduct with the Bledsoe’s, though others may disagree. Ryan has also stated that people from the Bilderberg group invited Chris to join one of their ceremonies and he said ""no""… simply because he is a good man. But not really sure what to make of that one but hey, why not, I mean Chris has already encountered a divine Mother Goddess who somehow had a hand in creating this eternal ocean of creative energy that we call the Universe, so why wouldn’t he be invited to a bilderberg sacrifice, right? 

There is so much to unpack here, but I will leave you with one last take away that I believe to be true, which is that in the future, people will refer to the regression transcripts of Chris Bledsoe and the messages he received from The Lady, as sacred texts.

528,aliens,TRUE STORY,"I would hold my hand on a bible and swear that this is true.

But I swear on my child grand mother that I’ve had a encounter.

First things first I prayed to god from my heart to send me a friend from another planet. I also prayed for alien technology that I knew how to use.

Sandusky Ohio I was at my dads house around 11:00pm I locked eyes with a alien just like your cat or dog sitting in front of you that’s how clear this was and I’ve found a similar picture it was identical to this alien but on the top of his head he had three little lights that were blinking and his eyes were brown he looked straight into my eyes and when our eyes connected he had the look of shock his eyes got really big like I’m busted and took off.  My dad woke me up the next morning and gave me a old NFL pro jacket I used to wear when I was 18 I’m 36 now he found it in the garage it was a cowboys jacket with stars all over it I was amazed.  

The picture attached is exactly what his size was eyes are perfect he was about 12 inches tall 

After this encounter strange things began to happen.  It felt like a ball of energy was attached to the top of my head and I could move this invisible force around by thinking it was moving.  It felt like a marble rolling around my head no clue what it was for.  Then about a week later I closed my eyes and there was this bright white light 💡 I stared at it for about 10 mins and then it tuned into like a mesh screen and started to form mountains then a airplan appeared and I was using this energy ball thing as the controller I was flying a airplane through Colorado mountains in fully immersed real life like graphics. Now I can do this anytime and can flip through games like a channel changer. 

I’ve had buzz cuts before and never did my head look like this I’ve attached a picture of what the top of my head looks like.

Weird things started happening with my vision I could autofocus in a weird new way when I use this new vision and look at light it looks like streams of rainbow light coming at me.

There’s many new abilities I have I fell kinda like a superhero and no one even knows and it’s impossible trying to explain it to people.",s9qny4,1,,1642814928.0,7,0.53
529,aliens,Speculating on the pattern of ETs' unfulfilled prophecies,"Those familiar with the literature, and who make an attempt at not bringing pre-concluding ideologies into their interpretations of UFOs and ETs, might hold to the hypothesis that the pattern of ETs telling witnesses/abductees of future events which do not come to pass is representative of purposeful misdirection -- that, in some way, these phenomena might be a collective and mercurial archetypal manifestation of the Trickster. It is an interesting hypothesis, and one I'm open to. If there is some desire by ETs to keep the matter of their presence on Earth obscured and inscrutable (at least to the public), prophecies which contactees are fed and then fervently believed in, yet which do not come to pass, do an excellent job of keeping the whole subject in the realm of cultish conspiracy theories entertained only by the mentally unstable or charlatans.

A striking example of one unfulfilled prophecy comes from pages 140-143 in David Jacobs' book, Secret Life (which I am in the process of reading), with the case of an abductee named Jason Howard. During his abduction experience, Howard is brought to a room with a screen by an ET and shown what is explained to be a future enormous atomic explosion. How far in the future? Howard is (curiously) not given a year but is rather told that it will occur a month before he is forty-years-old. At the time this account was given, Howard was 17, and the year was 1976. If this visualization were accurate, the aforementioned catastrophe would've happened well before now. Obviously, it did not.

In my estimation, there is another possibility which this pattern may represent. I have not seen this proposal made by anyone else. It stems from the pre-existing hypothesis that the Grays -- or at least one type of ET which anatomically fits into this typology -- are biological A.I., or androids. The android hypothesis has been arrived at in different ways. For me, it is suggested by these beings' almost programmatic behavior. Despite all the estimations we make of ETs' intellectual edge over us, certain cases present us with a humanoid psychology which appears nigh-emotionally retarded and uniformly clinical. I will illustrate this with another case from Jacobs' book, on page 129, where a woman recounts her abduction experience, wherein her son, Richard, was taken as well.

""*It knows that I'm saying something.... It either leaves Richard or it comes over to me next.* \[...\] *It says, 'Why do you interfere? Why do you want to interfere?' And I say, 'You have got to be kidding! You filthy, disgusting creature. You can't possibly be asking me that question.' It doesn't understand all that; it just says, 'Why do you interfere?'*""

Indeed, why would beings who at times purport to have ownership of the planet, as if there were its stewards (with the implication that they have been here for a substantial amount of time), be, by all appearances, unable to understand by now that their abductions are traumatic impositions? The evidence as such suggests that these beings are so full of themselves as to be effectively sociopathic, or are functionally incapable of recognizing the causes for emotionality (and are then perhaps incapable of such emotionality themselves). This latter possibility could be explained in different ways, and one of those explanations is that these Grays are androids who, while highly complex in certain ways, are highly constrained by whatever their programming is.

So here is what I mean to put forward for consideration: *what if something about these beings' programming has malfunctioned*? What if the pattern of prophesying once served a more explicable purpose but has become somehow -- maybe by willful intervention or the mere passage of time -- corrupted? If you will allow an even more wild sort of speculation: if we grant the possibility of alternate realities, and that UFOs/ETs may be capable of interdimensional travel, what if these beings' programming is tuned into the future or past events of *other* Earths, and has mistaken ours for another? Alternately: what if these ETs are indeed, at the time of their prophecies, somehow aware of the future, but are functionally unable to account for how the future may constantly be changing in a way which outwits their own mechanistic predictions?

Such hypothesizing clearly, at this time, cannot be tested (at least, not by anyone here). I am not sure if any of it is more or less disturbing than the Trickster hypothesis. Of course, if what we are dealing with here is programmatic corruption as a result of willful intervention, then perhaps it is in fact a facet of the Trickster archetype -- just in a way which may be all the more complicated and sinister.",s9py2n,9,,1642812744.0,2,0.85

* The content of Kennedy's letter was read out by John McCone at his confirmation hearing in front of the Armed Services Committee on January 18, 1962.
* The transcript of the confirmation hearing was printed by the U.S. Government Printing Office for use by the Armed Services Committee members
* Stanford University received a copy in 1962
* The transcript has some information in it that may have been sensitive at the time (after the Bay of Pigs but *before* the Cuban Missile Crisis) -relating to hydrogen bombs.
* Senator Eugene McCarthy questioned McCone at length about his role as head of the Atomic Energy Commission, in particular when 10 scientists from Cal Tech and Oak Ridge had signed a letter stating that they opposed the further research and development of the hydrogen bomb. The top scientist in the U.S., Dr. J. Robert Oppenhiemer, had lost his security clearance just a few years prior for expressing similar views.

I have reached out to the source to find out the circumstances of them receiving a copy of the document, if it was accessible to the general public, and at what date it was digitized. I will post the results in a new thread.

&#x200B;

The question of the authenticity of the content being written by Kennedy has been confirmed as true. What remains to be determined is whether the confirmation hearing of McCone was considered as ""classified"" to some extent. The hearing may have been conducted as an Open hearing, however, the discussions that transpired relating to nuclear weapons may have caused doubt amongst the archivists as to how it should be stored and accessed. I believe there is legislation requiring such transcripts to be distributed to various institutions, however the fact that the CIA archivists stored it as ""Unknown"" rather than ""Unclassified"" is telling (In the Intelligence Community, over-classifying information is considered almost as bad as under classifying it). Perhaps the Stanford copy was in a sealed, special collection section.

I shall update as information comes to hand.",s93oqa,424,,1642744291.0,248,0.82
537,aliens,"Most people know Betty and Barney Hill's story about being taken. Not many know the original abduction report from eight years earlier in Tujunga Canyon, CA.","*Name/Date/Location:* ""Sara Shaw,"" 21, and ""Jan Whitley,"" 22; March 22, 1953; Tujunga Canyon, CA. 


*Preliminary:* Witnesses in remote cabin awakened at 2:00A.M., noted that all nature sounds had ceased, and a moving blue light outside was casting shadows on the wall. Both felt giddy and confused and lost 
conscious memory until 4:20 A.M. 


*Initial activities:* Under hypnosis Shaw recalled that several shadowy beings approached the house and passed through a closed window and the kitchen door. The beings placed their hands on the two 
women and then seemed to control them. They debated whether to examine the witnesses in the cabin or to take them onto the craft, deciding on the latter. As the beings surrounded her and held her upper 
arms, Sara was floated toward the craft in a beam of light, her feet off the ground. When they touched her she felt tranquil and unafraid. Whitley, however, resisted and was rendered unconscious by an injection and carried on board. 


*Craft/Beings:* Small Saturn-shaped craft was hovering at a spot down the road; varicolored like mother-of-pearl, made a whining sound. Slender humanoids with narrow shoulders and long arms. Their skin felt dry and cool. Oval faces, no hair, long, narrow eyes. Something like a ski mask covered their faces leaving holes for the eyes. Black skintight coveralls, mittens, and rounded boots. Most were about 5 ft. (1.5 m) tall. Two taller beings, about 5 ft. 7 in. (1.7 m), seemed to be the leaders. A tall being in a light-colored suit with black stripes and bare hands (showing gray skin) directed onboard examination. 


*Onboard features:* They entered through a door above the rim of the craft and were taken to a large, domed examination room with a balcony surrounding it. There was a chair on casters and a table, and there were control panels on the walls. 


*Onboard activities:* Whitley struggled with the beings as they tried to examine her breasts. She was dragged into another room. They undressed Shaw and spent time examining a surgical scar that seemed to fascinate them. They took her to the table and levitated her above it. An anvil-like device descended from the ceiling on a rod and scanned her body. A tall being on the balcony directed the examination, call-
ing out instructions. Sara was taken to another room with chairs suspended in the air. 


*Communication:* The beings communicated without moving their lips 
(telepathy?) and reassured the women that they had nothing to fear and would not be hurt. More than once they indicated to Sara that she had lived a previous life. They discussed human rotting and a cure for 
cancer. 


*Termination/Return:* The beings instructed Shaw to forget what had  occurred. She was floated out a small window with her knees drawn up (see Budd Hopkins's ""Linda Cortile"" case) and returned to the cabin. At this point she saw her dog and cat outside the cabin and realized that they had also been taken on board. 


*Aftermath:* Shaw found herself seated on her bed at 4:20 A.M. Whitley was ""still"" standing by the closet where she had last been seen. The air was oppressive, and they fled the cabin. Whitley saw an apparition while en route to the car. Shaw's lifestyle changed considerably after the encounter. She terminated her lesbian relationship with Whitley and eventually married. She also gave up her assembly line job and entered the medical profession. The investigators discovered that during the 1960s and 1970s several of Whitley's and Shaw's friends and acquaintances were involved in apparently interrelated abductions.

Let's say there is an advanced civilization on Sirius. We point the Webb telescope over there and see an Earth-like planet. Sirius is about 8.6 light years away. We would be looking at what that planet looked like 8.6 years ago. If they had a badass telescope that could see the earths surface in detail they could be looking at 8.6 years ago as well.

Now this is where it gets interesting. Imagine another civilization much further that could be looking at our history from millions of years ago.

542,aliens,"Speculative solution to the Fermi Paradox, you know, for fun","It’s not a paradox. There is no one else here. Our reality and the dimensions in which we exist are a habitat for human intelligence. We are alone in what we perceive as the visible universe, but what is really more akin to an enclosure that’s a part of a larger menagerie we cannot understand, measure, consistently perceive, or access. 

Why is the Phenomenon so fleeting - evasive even? Why does it not demonstrate a concrete interest in applying its apparently incredible technology to meaningfully address the level of human suffering on this planet? Because our suffering and happiness are not really what’s important to whatever, or whoever, keeps us. Our success and failures are not important either. Our entire existence might not matter to our keepers in any way that we can understand or appreciate. 

What is important to them then? I don’t think that question has an answer that we can articulate - like a camel unable to comprehend that its intermittently appearing zoologist is interested in the role of cholesterol in its ability to conserve water, or grasp why the zoologist cares about that. 

I think there is one thing that whatever keeps us does care about though: That we, under no circumstances, take possession of or wield the tools/technology that would enable us to breach our enclosure. And if we do, we go the way of Harambe (RIP).

So, the height of our joy and depths of our suffering are completely relative, with no grander meaning. If we break the confines of our compartmented life within the architecture of the menagerie, a quick reset button gets hit on the human dimension - a sad violent little expression of consciousness that never made it off its home world into the larger sandbox designed for it.",s8x3pa,4,,1642724551.0,8,0.64

The weirdest thing about reading discussions regarding alien life is the absolute certainty displayed when stating strictly personal beliefs on the subject, whether founded or unfounded in concrete reality. It's quite bizarre to see, especially when many discussions seem to go as follows.

""I wonder if that video was legit? It makes me wonder how they fly.""

""Watch this documentary (name here). They fly by punching holes through space, and they're piloted by (insert trope). They're from the planet (insert name).""

Like, dude, you're saying it like you're presenting proven facts, whereas, in reality, you know as much as anybody else, and if you believe you possess factual knowledge, you only believe so because of the media you've chosen to view.

552,aliens,Two people completely independent of eachother shared Abduction / Paranormal stories with me that were shockingly corroborative.,"The first happened about 3 years ago. I was enjoying drinks at a local rooftop bar when I ran into my old elementary school teacher. I didn't know her that well but I did remember a few times that she had brought up aliens while we were kids. I say that because when me and my friends saw her she was already a little tipsy and started telling us some crazy stories about ufos and abductions. Essentially she said that her family members had been abducted and they've experienced  periods of lost time driving long distances. I believed her.

Two years later I was working at client location in NJ and found out our senior manager was was joining us mid-week to oversee the job. When he got there wednesday he took me and my other team member out to lunch. Lunch was okay, he was a little awkward from what seemed to be social interaction issues but a really nice guy. In a brief moment of silence he goes, so something weird happened to me and my family (low 40's with a wife and kids). Essentially he told us the same thing as my teacher, but from his point of view he offered no explanation as to what happened. He simply stated he was driving with his family and they all lost two hours of time while driving home at night from a family vacation.

The weird part was that my teacher said aliens only cared about certain bloodlines (noting her family comes from a small town in whales). when I got back from lunch both stories were fresh on my mind. For some reason I decided to look up the history of my managers last name the country of origin. What do you know his family name originated in whales as well.

To me, according abduction experiences, whether true or not, aliens don't have a peaceful reputation. When good experiences happen it seems they are implanting false memories through neurological engaging.

Although whether they are good or bad, I do think it's pretty cool that there might actually be intelligent life out there apart from us, whether they are aliens, demons or fallen/ angels. 

A few facts from abductions:   
Almost no one has been killed apart from some cattle/ human mutilations or people dying from fear after an abduction from a heart attack or are mentally controlled in doing harm to themselves or others.  
Aliens seem to be wanting us to take good care of the planet, which would be considered a good thing. On second thought, they are also interbreeding and try to replace us and make the planet for their own. It's a stealthy invasion, would you accept that even though it's our own habitable planet? Impregnating you against your will, rape have been reported or physical abuse for not cooperating, mentally control you without you realizing.

His alien models are [exceptionally similar](https://bphillipsart.blogspot.com/2012/08/early-work-ufo-exhibition-of-97-models.html?q=alien) to Skinny Bob and his huge interest in the video (both on [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/user/Bedeekinben/) and [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/user/Bedeekin)) put Ben Phillips at the top of the list of suspects.

After digging through [his blog](https://bphillipsart.blogspot.com/), I found [an alien](https://bphillipsart.blogspot.com/2012/08/early-work-ufo-exhibition-of-97-concepts.html?q=alien) he created in 1993 for some UFO magazine, and the design of this particular model instantly reminded me of [Area 51: The Alien Interview](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0404780/) (watch the entire footage [here](https://youtu.be/thdzV3VGzwo?t=1935)). This footage was allegedly leaked from Area 51 in 1997 by a man named ""Victor"".

Could Ben Phillips also be the creator of the Alien Interview creature?

559,aliens,Do we really want disclosure?,"      So l have been thinking about disclosure now a bit. I am nearly 50 and have been reading and taking in this medium for the last 35 years. My father used to drive taxis and had a craft fly over him one night at work in the 90s. I remember one night we were watching a documentary about UFOs and some kids had all witnessed the same craft so they were all interviewed differently and asked to draw it, when there drawings come up he was almost dancing cause he recognised it immediately.
      When l was younger l couldn't understand why anyone would keep this from us. I remember the Xfiles days and when it ended the rumours it was a way to start a discussion to get disclosure happening. I watched lots of videos and tried to keep an open mind. 
    Now l have gotten older. I'm greying up. I have a bit of life experience under my belt and l think another more deeply about things. So l still have no doubt we are visited and have been for a very long time. Why don't they contact as us equals.....well cause we aren't equals. Humans think we are so superior to everything but in fact we are incredibly stupid. There are a few incredibly intelligent ppl amongst us but they are few and far between.
    Now to get to where my original question was, imagine of the reports that we have read, watched or witnessed 5 percent of them were truthful....heck even 1 percent. All of the abduction stories are scary as hell. What government in their right mind would come out and say oh yeah, Aliens, their real. By the way you could get abducted at any time. Oh we have no idea how to protect you and um we really have no idea on what we are dealing with. Put that in context of today...we have a virus that we know is real, that is killing us and people get scared, it get politicialised by extremists trying to get easy votes and now we are at war with each other.

560,aliens,What if extraterrestrials came to Earth thousands of years ago after some sort of catastrophic event to their own planet or solar system. They’ve been preserving/rebuilding their genetic heritage through Homo Sapiens here on Earth ever since..,"What if extraterrestrials came to Earth thousands of years ago after some sort of catastrophic event to their own planet or solar system. They’ve been preserving/rebuilding their genetic heritage through Homo Sapiens here on Earth ever since.. 

This idea has been on my mind after reading and hearing mention of it in several popular books and movies. It is of course speculation, although to me it remains a “simple” explanation for why ET are here and have been here all along. The hypothesis can explain ETs earthen presence for millennia. It can explain the genetic connection which we see demonstrated in many religions texts and abduction events. It can help explain why ETs seem to prioritize the cultural and scientific development of humans, clearly seen in our accelerated evolution.

It’s almost as if Earth were an “ark” of sorts, a place to preserve the diversity of life. A spin on an idea stretching far back into antiquity.

Currently, I’d argue ET are here again as promised! Yet their contact with us is far more complicated than before. We now have weapons that can destroy them, and of course all life here on earth. This period could represent a most pivotal and dangerous time in “the process”. We now have an opportunity to ascend to the stars and into the greater universe beyond. We are experiencing a window were we can actually understand the technologies required to accomplish this like never before. We can also destroy ourselves and the Earth in the process.. A great reason for ETs to return once again, to guide us towards whatever success lies ahead. 

I think the evidence points towards contact in the near future.

Some evidence:

The hard to explain “accelerated evolution” of Homo Sapiens beginning roughly 40,000 years ago.

Many accounts in ancient texts from the world over of “civilizers” coming from the heavens to teach man how to live. Then leaving back to the heavens with promises of some day returning again.

The stunning stone architecture seen around the world that does not fit with our understanding of the technical capabilities of the people during the time. 

Advanced understanding of math, science, astronomy etc. that does not fit with our understanding of the technical capabilities of the people during the time. Capabilities that much of the time seem to develop without an obvious prehistory.

Dissemination of this knowledge around the world despite there being no contact between these cultures. Cultures separated by vast oceans and the expanse of time.

Countless mention of sex between “the sons of god” and “the daughters of man” in ancient texts the world over.

The genetic component to abduction events and possibly cattle mutilations 

An evolutionary trajectory not demonstrated by any other form of life yet observed here on earth.

The 1.2 percent of our DNA that makes us so incredibly unique.

A clear interest by ET/UAP in all things nuclear her on earth.

While driving on State Highway 26, Guy Tossie and Willie Begay saw a flash of light, then a small disc with two beings visible in its clear dome hovered in front of their car, about 5 feet (1.5 meters) above the road. The area was bathed in a vivid green light. A ring of flashing green and orange lights rotated around its center (like another event  reported on July 13, 1959, Blenheim, New Zealand). 


Their car came to a halt by itself. The clear dome opened as if hinged at one side, and one of the beings floated down next to the car. It was 3 to 3.5 feet tall with a face that appeared deeply scarred or lumpy, prominent ears, round eyes, and no nose or lips. The being had a deep chest, and tight-fitting coveralls. A flat backpack 
protruded above its head. Only two fingers were visible on one hand. 


The being opened the driver's door and pushed his way into the car, grabbing the steering wheel. The car was drawn as if towed 75 feet off the highway into an adjacent field. While this was happening, the craft maintained a fixed position relative to the car, ""like the car was fastened to it.""


Tossie jumped from the car and fled down the highway to a farmhouse. He saw a bright light following him and thought it must be the second being. 


Begay, who had been driving, said the being twice spoke in a high-pitched, rapid voice, 
""like a woman ... or a bird,"" but he made no attempt to reply. He was so terrified that he felt faint. 


The being then left the car, joined by the second being, and both floated back up to the craft and reentered it. The top closed, its colors brightened, and it rose in a zigzag path. A yellow light shot from the bottom center and ""played like flame,"" and the object took off at high speed with a whirring sound and rush of air and disappeared. 


Meanwhile, at the farmhouse Willard Hammon heard loud, frantic knocking and opened his front door. The frightened Tossie was invited in and began talking incoherently about a light that drove their 
car off the road and a ""dead"" friend. Hammon suggested they return to the scene, but Tossie was too frightened.


After he calmed down, he agreed to go 
along with Hammon and Hammon's son, Bob. 


When they arrived at the scene, the car's headlights were still on and the motor was running. Begay sat trembling behind the steering wheel, his eyes closed. 


After he stopped shaking, the witnesses were able to start driving home, and the Hammons stopped for coffee. A county sheriff and a local policeman came 
in, and soon so did Tossie and Begay, who said they were too scared to go home alone. They told their story to the police, who contacted the state police, and an investigator was sent. Cpl. Tom Harper of the Idaho State Police met the witnesses at the scene of the incident and checked the car for radioactivity or other evidence, with negative results. A storekeeper reported ""a number of frightened dogs and stampeded cattle in the vicinity that same night."" 


Also the same evening, Mrs. Claude Mann said her cattle broke through a steel-pipe gate and ran for about two miles. After they were rounded up and corralled, they broke 
through the fence again. 


A NICAP investigator found another witness-who insisted on remaining anonymous for fear of ridicule-who said that a small object had descended in front of his truck later that evening near Ririe, causing the vehicle to stop. A small being came out of the object and approached the truck, tapping on the windshield. The man was terrified and thought he was going crazy, but he managed to escape. The next 
morning the man heard a report about Begay and Tossie's experience on the radio and, according to a friend, ""turned white as a sheet."" Local citizens who were interviewed considered the Tossie and Begay report a real event. *See* NICAP investigation report by C. Reed Hicks; Keyhoe and Lore (1969a), 31-32; (1969b), 23-27.


About a month later in Idaho Falls, ID, about 20 miles southwest of Ririe, Marilyn Wilding, 15, had a similar sighting. At 7:40 P.M. on December 8, she noticed that the snow was brightly illuminated. She looked up and saw a disc with a transparent dome. The craft tipped forward, revealing two humanoid figures inside the transparent dome, partly concealed by a bright glare. They seemed to be watching her. The object then rotated clockwise, rose, and moved away to the north. *See* NICAP investigation report by C. Reed Hicks.",s7zlh2,122,,1642623953.0,39,0.96
565,aliens,NATO and UFOs,"UFOs and NATO - The Human Mutilation Cover Up (Summary provided at the bottom). There’s no disturbing pictures ITT.

This documentary was released back in 2014 and updated in 2015. A lot of the details which sounded crazy at the time of release are now being confirmed years later by people like Luis Elizondo, Ross Coulthart and Garry Nolan.

This is the update released in 2015, it's the only versions you really need to watch:

https://youtu.be/gXsWehcg1KI

https://youtu.be/tOMujMC-k8o

Here's the summary where I point out some very significant details provided back in 2014/2015:

1. The military witness is suffering from injuries consistent with getting too close to a UFO. He has Multiple Sclerosis and is either confined to a wheelchair or uses two crutches. (Recent mention of pseudo multiple sclerosis effects: [https://www.vice.com/en/article/n7nzkq/stanford-professor-garry-nolan-analyzing-anomalous-materials-from-ufo-crashes](https://www.vice.com/en/article/n7nzkq/stanford-professor-garry-nolan-analyzing-anomalous-materials-from-ufo-crashes)).

2. The UFO effort is a US-led NATO operation, the witness is one of eleven volunteers selected from UK Special Forces at that time.

3. The military witness describes ETs as looking like ""a devil"" - The Varginha witnesses also used that description for the red-eyed, horned creatures they encountered. 

4. ETs could rip people apart.

5. ET craft contained human body parts and also animal parts. [https://www.reddit.com/r/UFOB/comments/qf9ugg/luis\_elizondo\_quote\_about\_humans\_not\_being\_top\_of/](https://www.reddit.com/r/UFOB/comments/qf9ugg/luis_elizondo_quote_about_humans_not_being_top_of/)

6. Most of the soldier's team have suffered skin cancers and tumors from radiation exposure; some have died from their injuries. [https://www.reddit.com/r/UFOB/comments/qqkbso/new\_information\_about\_radiation\_exposure\_and\_time/](https://www.reddit.com/r/UFOB/comments/qqkbso/new_information_about_radiation_exposure_and_time/). 

7. The military has advanced warning of UFOs - Very significant information, only recently released by Lue Elizondo and Ross Coulthart. The military witness was not privy to how the UFOs were being predicted but we now know the incoming craft give off a specific electromagnetic frequency.

8. UFO missions occur roughly 4 times in a 6 month period, at least in the UK.

9. This particular ET race is not friendly.

10. Military witness speculates that the ETs have been here since before humanity.

11. Opening fire on a UFO does not normally damage it.

12. The military have at least eight laser-based systems around the world that can bring down UFOs - Very significant information, Lue Elizondo has alluded to the military's ability to interfere with the space-time bubble around these UFOs causing them to drop out of the sky like a brick.

13. The military swarms a location in anticipation of a UFO’s arrival and then fires their laser-based weapon - Very significant information, matches the Pentyrch UFO incident of 2016 ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJTGpxOqzjA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJTGpxOqzjA))

14. The military witness has seen hundreds of UFOs, some of them landed.

15. The UFOs witnessed were square, rectangular or triangular, not flying saucers. Ranged in size from a car to 3 times the size of an articulated truck. Surfaces were smooth, some had overlapping tiles. All had lights of varying colors and configurations.

16. One craft gave off light resembling an arc welder which damaged the soldier's eyes.

17. Another craft looked metallic but had elastic properties when pushed by hand. 

18. Some of the craft were very small (car size), speculates they might have come from a mothership.

19. UFOs just appear out of nowhere - Very significant information, as this could allude to the possible inter-dimensional nature of these craft.

20. UFOs come down to the ground very quick – Good information, resembles properties of the Tic Tac UFO that descended 80,000 feet in less than a second.

21. Largest recovery of bodies was in Australia (24 bodies) - Significant information, remote parts of Australia were the location of historic nuclear tests and also very secretive US bases as recently disclosed by Ross Coulthart. Perfect place to bring down UFOs, very remote.

22. UFOs choose remote areas for human mutilations, victims included adults and children. I advise people to check on Llanbedr on google maps and see how small and remote it is, no surprise they would target people from similar locations.

23. No communication occurred during ET encounters (Luis Elizondo has alluded to this).

24. ETs are incredibly quick, moving 60 meters in a split second - Very significant information, there is a lot of evidence that these beings don't experience linear time so they appear to teleport when humans observe them (Example [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggyW\_PuOcw8&t=2315s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggyW_PuOcw8&t=2315s)).

25. ETs are not friendly and you would not approach one without military cover because they are so quick (Reminds me of this Brazilian incident [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0oveu-k7ng](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0oveu-k7ng)).

26. Military witness observed two ETs wearing something resembling a wet suit or flight suit which was silver in color – Significant information as a lot of these visitors seem to wear these suits.

27. Military witness observed 3 distinct types of ET. Possibly the same way there’s black, white and asian people etc. Still the same race.

28. On 4 or 5 occasions, smashed UFOs allowed the soldiers to observe the interior of the craft which included human and animal body parts.

29. Military witness referenced a top secret UK military installation allegedly used to track UFOs.

30. The American UFO NATO team had 495 personnel including 30 commanders. If this entire thing is real, these people are incredibly professional to keep their mouth shut this entire time.

31. UFOs caused burn marks on the ground and sometimes twisted trees almost full circle - Significant detail (see this interview for similar evidence [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moYKeZ6YE1Q](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moYKeZ6YE1Q)).

32. Mutilated victims were young-ish, some of whom were children. 

33. Witness got within 5 feet from a UFO, it had no windows, hovered off the ground and radiated heat. Exposure to the craft caused him to fall unconscious and he later woke up in hospital.

34. Military witness observed small objects near the mutilated bodies – Perhaps watching our response, which is similar to US pilot and sailor accounts of UFO harassment.

35. Military witness discovered an empty car with the engine running in a remote part of Wales, heavily mutilated bodies of the car occupants were discovered 2 weeks later at a location 3 kilometers away. 

36. A resident of Wales observed a UFO hovering over his car and the car was covered in a white dust - Similar to the Pentrych UFO witness who described something resembling snow falling from the sky after a UFO was allegedly brought down.

Summary - The UK authorities are alleged to have allowed a US-led NATO task force to ambush UFOs over UK territory during the 1990's. In return, the UK received 2 high-tech laser weapons capable of bringing down UFOs and 11 UK Special Forces personnel were recruited to the NATO operation. Numerous craft were collected, at least some contained human and animal body parts. UFO occupants were presumably killed and/or captured.

This post will get deleted because it doesn’t suit the idea that every alien is benevolent. While obviously you shouldn’t treat this post like it’s the 100% truth, you should without a doubt keep it in your grey hat.

The following documentary linked below is about the 2016 Pentrych UFO incident that appears to confirm a lot of details:

566,aliens,One of our greatest analytic oversights might be the stereotyping of ETs,"For a while, I have had the thought that, by referring to UFOs and ETs as a singular phenomenon (or by asserting that there has always been the same ET presence on Earth), and by assigning uniform traits to each of the beings, we might be doing ourselves an analytic disservice. Of course, analysis of the subject is difficult enough as it is, and this would only make navigating it all the more complex; and, prejudicial as it may be, stereotyping is fundamentally a pattern-constructing method.

But it is possible that, for instance, humans' interactions with a certain kind of ET might be representative of those beings' race inasmuch as an outsider's interaction with, say, some faction of a nation's military-scientific industrial complex would be representative of humanity as a whole. It is not a matter of course, for instance, that the beings mentioned in the Book of Enoch -- were we to interpret them as ETs -- are the same faction of certain beings seen in the 20th and 21st centuries.

We can most obviously see this tendency to stereotype play out in our genres of science-fiction and fantasy, where this or that race is characterized according to, say, some uniform emotional trait, while humans are depicted as being relatively dynamic because they occupy a behavioral median. So, despite perhaps looking similar, there may be notable differences between, say, the ETs observing nuclear bases or sites for weaponry testing and some of the ETs who abduct humans.",s7wy3b,30,,1642617231.0,14,0.95

I one time called the report line that was listed on the national ufo reporting centers website, but the guy on the phone was an asshole and didn't take me seriously because I had no photographic evidence of the ""abduction"". Ever since I can remember I've always had an owl that occupies a neighboring tree to my home no matter where I live, there's currently one that lives in the redwood in my neighbors yard that likes to show itself when I ever I step out my door at night. Sometimes it will follow me when I walk to the corner cigarette store and back. Ive also had a night where I once lost about 8 hours of time at a cabin up in humboldt County with no recollection of this specific night, just remembering waking up on the couch of the cabin with my clothes still on and shoes(I was not drunk). Ive also in the past couple of months have had a dream where it was a half conscious sleep paralysis moment and they were in my bedroom, 2 of them. One standing at the foot of my bed watching over me and the other was peeking out of the closet also starring at me. In the past I have witnessed several UAP/UFOs, ive also recently learned about a story where my late grandfather once encountered a grey running past in front of his truck in the middle of the night on his way home from work in the Mojave desert antelope Valley area in the mid 80s(my family has a history of sightings/encounters).

A few topics of this discussion that are prominent within this communicated conversation is technological size capacity. 

& A few key items that absolutely silence the phone every single time, is the topic of the history of the physical removal &/or the placement of Star systems via Electronic equipment &/or the physical removal/placement of planets via electronic equipment. 

Both seem to be in a sense a reality of historical capacity for something that can sense preservation & life form sustainability is vastly more important for multiple species.

575,aliens,My viewpoint on the Fermi Paradox,"If something has even the slightest chance to happen (e.g. life), given a scale as big as the universe and an amount of time, it will happen. Earth is proof life can thrive within this universe. Given the amount of undiscovered (and discovered) Earth like planets, it's only logical to conclude we aren't alone.

However, I dont think we will encounter intelligent life for a very long time. Intelligent life evolves when a species constantly relies on using their brain, over generations, that makes the species intelligent. Looking at all the different species on Earth, we can see that intelligent life is not common. I believe that intelligent life would be very very spread out within the universe. 

Sorry this post is a bit of a ramble, but let me know if you have any thoughts.",s75osi,8,,1642534311.0,14,0.73

In such a scenario, how are you affected and how would you react? How would you beliefs and interests change? Would you be in favour of governments funding large scale xeno-paleontology efforts on Mars? What sort of theories would you entertain in light of such information?",s72jk1,24,,1642526262.0,38,0.91
578,aliens,(Is there a human mating program) was it love at first sight? Or an extraterrestrial mating algorithm installed on the human species at conception?,"It’s an algorithm.

A little about my experience. Almost three years ago I started an intensive meditation routine intended on psychic brain development. At month 3-4 in November of 2019 I had an initial contact experience where a (minimized window) or reserved portion of the brain became active allowing vision into a HUD style system that appears to be a remotely operated psionic brain interface. In short, it’s Extraterrestrial Brain Technology.

This was the start of complex journey using my leadership psychology education to decipher what parts of this program platform, if possible, were terrestrial in nature or completely unknown altogether. In conclusion, now after years of interacting with this device or platform, the physical reality of earth becomes very different.

The initial experience of ‘human intuition’ or listening to the ‘little voice’ in your head as a human cognitive function for self reflection. Had been localized & simplified to a very visible drop down list of AI programs that could be linked directly to thought patterning & audible communication in addition to induced neural impulses connected to the visualization memory parts of the brain. In a completely organized fashion. (likely from UAP Both onboard & remotely installed)

These programs also appear to have access to human reproduction in totality. Essentially designed to orchestrate fluid gender identity, sexual identity. Daily thought process & visualization patterning, in addition to social programming. Who you physically can or can not be friends with or socialize with through designed neurological impulses, completely remotely operated. This includes birth rate, conception & physical lifespan as well.

In essence, the daily patterns of human life can be directly related back to a programming protocol & Server Based operated Data system, likely hosted by numerous extraterrestrial species.

The programming list is intensive & very clearly labeled. My main thought now is how to approach human sustainability & directional leadership essentially. From this pilot seat what appears is a breakdown of a economic system well in momentum, while a host system operates the majority of the species daily operations.

My main concern is healthcare. From an educated field of doctors, human biology is a science. From the programming side it appears to be a population control operation intended on limiting human growth. Essentially all of the physical health parameters can be identifiable (visibly) on a programming list that is installed remotely, likely causing the trillions of dollars in medical expenses annually.

Also, In reflection of MLK day, it very clearly is programming population segregation in a physical species wide algorithm, again psionic mind control intended on limiting human growth.

—————————

Tbh I care about my family, my family’s future & the future of the planet.

My question Likely costing ‘trillions of dollars.’ How do I communicate this effectively to a large enough demographic of humans to generate something to functionally guide the species to a safer Extraterrestrial interaction?

Or is someone else working on this already in the public sector? & Who do I contact? I feel like this needs to be on the front page of something.

587,aliens,"There have been several contact events that featured a so-called ""Scout Craft"" with pilots inside. Here are a few of those events:","From ""The UFO Evidence"" Chapter XIII:

Dyad ""Scout Craft"" 


A striking pattern of reports has emerged describing what appears to be a standard model UFO, of intermediate size between the small-possibly remote-controlled-discs and the often-reported 35-40 foot (10-12 meter) in diameter or larger models. 

Dating back to the 1950s, many witnesses have described discs (often Saturn-shaped) with transparent domes through which two small humanoid beings are visible. 
Although size estimates vary, most appear to be somewhere between 15 and 30 feet (4.5 and 9 meters) in diameter. The proportional size of beings to craft suggests a small two-seater ""scout"" vehicle with barely enough space to accommodate the two-entity crew. The reports imply a mission-oriented purpose.


The beings in these cases often exhibit awareness of the witness, looking right at him or her. The craft performs characteristic maneuvers that include a downward tilt, during which instrument panels on board become visible, and rotation. Certain colors and light arrays 
recur. 

The following case summaries illustrate the Dyad ""scout craft."" 


*July 13, 1959: Blenheim, New Zealand. 5:50 A.M.*

Mrs. Frederick Moreland, a part-time nurse's aide, was helping her husband tend their nine-acre farm. It was dark with low cloud cover when she went to the barn to do the morning milking. She noticed a green glow in the overcast and was halfway across the paddock when two large green lights emerged from the clouds and descended rapidly toward the ground in her direction. ""I noticed that I was bathed in a green light and that all the paddock was green, too,"" she later reported. In a statement to local police, she said that the green glare was so bright that she could not see her own ""torchlight"" (flashlight beam). ""It was a horrid sort of color. My first thought was, 'I shouldn't be here,' and I made a dive for the trees on the other side of the paddock."" 

From the protection of the trees, Mrs. Moreland saw a distinct saucer-shaped object with two extremely bright sources of green light on its underside that illuminated an area of 50 yards (45 meters). Two rows of what seemed to be jets around the center of the object were emitting orange-colored flame. The rows appeared to revolve in opposite directions. The object, about 20-30 feet (6-9 meters) in diameter, hovered at rooftop level, about 15 feet (4.5 meters) above the ground. It was no more than 50 yards ( 45 meters) away from her. 

""The jets stopped,"" she said, ""and a light was switched on in what appeared to be a Perspex [plastic] or glass roof or dome which glowed."" The underside was a gray, metallic color. She could hear a faint hum, and ""the air became very warm."" Inside the transparent dome were two men ""dressed in fairly close-fitting suits of shiny material."" She compared the color to aluminum foil. They wore ""opaque helmets"" that rose straight from their shoulders. They seemed to be of normal size. One, she noticed, never moved. 

""I could not see their faces,"" she said. ""One of the men stood up and put two hands out in front of him, as if leaning over to look downward. He then sat down and, after a minute or two, the jets started off again and, tilting slightly at first, the thing shot up vertically at great speed and disappeared into the clouds. When it did this, it made a soft but high-pitched sound."" A peculiar peppery smell lingered in the air. 


*1 October 24, 1967: Newfield, NY. 9:30 P.M.*

 An object with ""knob"" and ""antenna"" on top approached, tilted down. Two humanoid figures and control panels were seen through windows. The UFO then tilted back up and shot out of sight in seconds. Static was heard on hand-held radios during the sighting. 



*November 2, 1967: Ririe, ID. 9:30P.M.*

Two men driving along the highway saw a light flash, then a small disc with two beings visible inside the transparent dome hovered directly in front of their car. The area was bathed in green light. A ring of flashing green and orange lights rotated around the edge of the object. The men had a frightening encounter with two small beings who ""floated"" down from the craft. 



*December 8, 1967: Idaho Falls, ID. 7:40P.M.*

 Marilyn Wilding, 15, went out on her front step to look for a friend who was coming to pick her up. The evening was dark and overcast, and there was snow on the ground. A light reflecting on the snow caused her to look up, and she saw a brightly lighted circular object ""about as big as a car"" hovering above the house. As she stood looking at it, the object tipped and rotated so she could see that it had a transparent dome on top. Within the dome were two figures whose features were indistinct because of the bright glare. The object rotated clockwise (as seen from below), but maintained its tilted attitude while rotating, therefore giving the appearance of wobbling. The object then began moving away and, as it receded into the distance, its light dimmed and turned orange in color. The departure was observed by Wilding's siblings inside the house. 



*January 1, 1970: Duncan, B.C., Canada. About 5:00 A.M.*

Mrs. Doreen Kendall, a registered nurse, looked out a window at the hospital and saw a spacecraft-like object hovering one story above her, about 60 feet (18 meters) off the ground and 40 feet (12 meters) away. The object was Saturn-shaped, about 50 feet (15 meters) in diameter, silvery metallic, with a row of lights around the middle. Two humanoid figures in dark tight-fitting clothing were visible in the upper portion. They wore headgear that obscured their facial features. One stood at an instrument panel and the other behind the first. The second being turned and looked directly at the nurse and touched the first being, who then operated a lever, and the craft tilted down, providing a view of its interior. Mrs. Kendall called other witnesses who arrived in time to see the object as it departed.



*June 27, 1970: Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. 11:40 A.M.*

Aristeu Machado, his wife and children, and Joao Aguiar, of the Brazilian Federal police, saw a domed disc resting on the surface of the Atlantic Ocean, an estimated 700-1,000 meters offshore. It was a gray metallic color. Two humanoid figures were standing on the rim of the disc. After a while the object skimmed the surface of the water and took off, lights flashing from its underside. Once airborne, the wife could see clearly the two occupants sitting inside the object. 



*April 16, 1974: Casale Monferrato, Italy. 12:50 A.M.* 

Mauro Bellingeri, 26, and his wife, Carla, were driving home to Santa Maria del Tempio when they noticed a bright object in the sky. The object dove abruptly toward the car, stopping at a height of about 12 meters. The Bellingeris both got out of the car to look at the now motionless and silent object. It was disclike with a bright, transparent dome and a central ring of revolving red, green, and yellow lights. Inside the round dome were three human-like beings with large round, opaque grayish helmets. At the base of the headgear was a hoselike apparatus reminiscent of oxygen equipment used by frogmen. The being closest to them turned in their direction, then returned to his original position. All three beings then rotated in unison. At this point, three top four jets of flame appeared beneath the craft, the central portion with lights on it began to revolve rapidly, and a whistling sound was heard. The Bellingeris felt a blast of air, and the UFO sped away, continuing to emit a whistling sound.



*May 3, 1975: San Antonio, TX. 9:15 P.M.*

Alois Olenick, 48, was driving his 1959 Chevrolet pickup truck westward on Mogford Road, south of the city, when an unidentified aerial craft approached and 
beamed a spotlight down on him. At the same time, his truck was nearly buffeted off the road as if by a strong wind. As the UFO approached, the main light on its front changed from amber to a ""bright, cherry red,"" becoming most intense during the close encounter. ""When the craft got directly over the top of my pickup,"" Olenick said, ""my lights went completely out and my engine was dead."" The object was basically globular in shape with protrusions on either side that could have been a central ring (making an overall Saturn-shape). The bottom looked like ""highly polished metal"" with a reddish glow, possibly a reflection of the primary red light. Visible inside the transparent dome on top were two humanoid beings. During the close-range sighting, the craft was tilted at about a 40-degree angle and oriented so that one of the occupants was directly in Olenick's line of sight. He said, ""They appeared to be just as interested in me as I was in them. One of the occupants, the one farthest away from me, appeared to be the pilot and had his hands on what looked like controls. He was looking up and away from me. The other occupant looked directly at me . . . and appeared to be observing me. I got a good look at both of them. They weren't human beings like we see here."" The beings appeared to be five feet tall or under, bald, with prominent ears and a prominent nose. Their eyes were like slits, and their skin was smooth and gray. As the UFO departed almost instantaneously, Olenick heard a very loud wind sound that he compared to a cyclone, and his truck was buffeted. While the craft hovered over his truck, Olenick detected a strong odor ""like burning copper or electrical wiring"" (he was a sheet metal worker). ""I feel like they got a look at me, and maybe got my picture or something, and then turned their lights off and vanished.""



*Late September 1977: Parkstone, Poole, Dorset, UK. 11:00 P.M.*

Mrs. Ethel May Field, 62, was in her backyard taking clothes off the clothes-
line. She heard a humming noise and looked up. The sky was clear. Approaching from the south-southwest she saw a circular object with a dome on top emitting brilliant light. Its surfaces were gray, and brilliant blue-yellow (green?) light was being emitted from the underside. The object appeared to be about 20 feet in diameter. Through windows in the dome she saw two humanoid figures visible almost to the waist. The object stopped and hovered above her garden, its light so brilliant that she put her hands up to shield her eyes. When she did, she felt heat on her hands and a trembling or vibration of the ground for a second or two. The occupants had silver suits and headgear. Their faces appeared slender, their arms normal, their hands covered by silvery material. The figure on the right appeared to be operating controls, his hands extended downward and out of sight. The being on the left was looking directly at her, and made a gesture as if pointing downward, which she interpreted as being an intention to land. This alarmed her and she ran back to the house to alert her husband and child. She paused at the door to glance back and saw the object speeding away to thenorthwest. In the following week she developed skin irritation on the palms of her hands, which had been facing outward when she shielded her eyes from the bright light. She had never before had a skin condition of this kind.



*August 4, 1979: Canoga Park, CA. 10:35 P.M.*

A woman and her grandson saw a disc-shaped craft with clear dome on top approach from the west. Two humanoid beings with oversized heads were visible inside. The object stopped and hovered above an apartment building across the street, within a few hundred feet. It tilted to one side, then returned to horizontal, and flew behind a tree, stopped, tilted the other way. Finally it flew away back toward the west. The weather was clear and warm. Both witnesses were frightened by the craft. 



Small craft with two beings have been observed on or near the ground in many other humanoid encounter and confrontation cases.

Humanity has a tendency to attribute our own personal way of thinking and operations on to other which isn’t always correct as we see when different cultures can’t always understand how other cultures live. What if we’ve done the same thing thinking about humanity from 4000 years ago? 

My theory is that humanity 4000 years ago thought and operated so differently to how we do now that it was be alien to us. We can see from physical evidence and documents an extent to how they lived and we’ve then applied our current way of thinking to that which leaves gaps that can’t be filled. We’ve when then jumped to “it must have been aliens”.

This is why I cringe when people used movie examples to explain why alien disclosure will happen in real life. For example, a lot of people just think the Government is just going to confirm that aliens exist one day. After years of hiding aliens from the public. And that's what disclosure is to them.

This sounds like the generic plot to every alien movie ever lol. I don't like how people based the reality on possible aliens or cringey Hollywood movies. No aliens are not here to invade, they are not here to help us on our spiritual journey, and they are not here to work with the Government.

I don't really know how to post this as I don't want to get caught up in my own excitement and make it come off as a joke or anything but I don't really know where else to post this, and you guys are my best shot at believing me as even my family seemed skeptical. 

Last night heading east bound about 7:40PM, I was on the phone with my GF when I had to cut her off mid sentence, far and above a local small airport there were 5 lights in a V shape formation, spaced out enough and far to high for drones. 

The lights were like giant orbs, I know they weren't passenger planes as I could see them flying far below them and they had the red/green light markings that planes have, these lights were much larger and much brighter. 

My intention was to pull over, but I was heading on the highway exit ramp which is at a strong uphill then downhill curve, followed up by a lot of construction and police with their lights on so I was unfortunately unable. 

I will say that the lights ""blinked"" out, or went dark, first the back 2, followed by the forward 3, so imagine the ""wings"" going dark, and then the cockpit.  

Anyway, yes I'm a believer but I do try and approach these things with a bit of skepticism, first the lights were much higher than drones, okay so not drones. Second the lights absolutely dwarfed the plane lights flying in the area, okay so not planes. Third the lights were very spaced out. 

Anyway, I understand without picture proof that this is likely to be considered bunk and I totally get that, but I did just want to atleast type it out and say my peace.

597,aliens,One of the reasons that Extra-Terrestrials have not yet shown themselves on a wide-scale reveal to humanity is because it would shatter many peoples realities,"If you are familiar with vibrations and vibrational levels, then you know that some people cannot handle high vibrations and these beings (E.T.s) are often of a much higher vibration than humans so for many, seeing them in a way that they cannot deny, whether it be meeting an actual E.T. “face-to-face” or seeing an actual space craft/s (i.e. UFO) would cause trauma (and for some, may actually trigger insanity) because they are not designed to accept these energies and experiences.

&#x200B;

The E.T.s avoid subjecting many people to this because they are benevolent.

&#x200B;

You can say that malevolent E.T.s do not want to be known for their own nefarious purposes (and I won’t argue with you on that) but I truly believe it’s benevolence that is behind the lack of sightings (and no recent mass sightings with clear evidence).

&#x200B;

I know that we have many videos of sightings (and some of these may actually be real, some are even plausible) but how many people are ready for an undeniable sighting?

&#x200B;

Very few.

&#x200B;

I heard an example given: if a non-threatening, unarmed alien appeared beside you right now would you be at ease or would you feel overwhelmed, perhaps even terrified?

&#x200B;

It depends on your vibrational level at the time (as people vary throughout the day, generally) but if you are a true believer of E.T.s than you may have a much better reaction than the majority of people, though I’d imagine you’d still be afraid.

&#x200B;

This is why it’s important for humanity to raise their vibration and consciousness before E.T.s do a “big reveal” that cannot be denied or ignored.

They will most likely do this reveal by hovering over a large/major city in their space craft, in clear view of hundreds (if not thousands) of people, allowing people to talk and discuss what they are seeing, having the ability to clearly record on cameras, etc, and with some people even livestreaming so as to allow the whole world to see clearly, again, so as not to have people deny or ignore it.

&#x200B;

What is also important for this situation is that this happens without any threat of aggressive military action such as having missiles fired at the craft or jets flying around, making the situation feel very threatening to the general public.

&#x200B;

Humans are close to an event like this in the next 5 years, I believe.

&#x200B;

603,aliens,Occams Razor Explanation for the Fermi Paradox,"So here's a logical argument that I'll lay out. If advanced species are out there, then they have managed to evolve beyond the point of destroying themselves with technology they created. That is a given.

That means that they have some sense of using it responsibly.

A very irresponsible - I would go as far as to say, abusive - use of that would be to get involved with less advanced civilizations and really screw with their development. It's would be a tremendous abuse of the power they hold with their advancements.

We know that, for instance, there is a tribe in Africa that, having never seen planes before, and US Army planes landing in their region, they began an entire culture of praying to and celebrating them as Gods. (They no longer believe that, though they have retained culture and traditions they developed.) We can easily say that is not a healthy situation, for a less advanced culture to be praying to that culture simply because they have technology that looks like magic or supernatural abilities.

All you have to do is extrapolate that to humanity and advanced civilizations capable of space travel, and there's no reason to think the same principle doesn't apply.

Using that logic, the Occams Razor explanation for the Fermi paradox, is that **other species have, for the most part, agreed to leave us the f\*\*k alone while we advance to becoming a space-faring species, because that's the healthiest thing to do for us.**

One response I got from mentioning this was ""We're not living in Star Trek, this isn't Sci-Fi"". Like that has anything to do with the logic behind it.

We've managed to figure out in our Sci-Fi stories that advanced civilizations messing with, or even dominating over less advanced ones would be an extremely immoral and irresponsible thing to do. It has played out that way between humans on our own planet. So what are the odds that civilizations that have actually mastered the advanced technology necessary for space travel have also concluded the same thing? I would say they are pretty high.

And using the same logic, it's easy to say that they probably want to **leave us alone until** **we stop killing each other**. That would be supported by the many credible reports from nuclear weapons facilities of encounters and unexplained malfunctions and interference, being some of the most devastating and prolific weapons capable of mass murder that humans have developed. Wouldn't you want to limit your interaction with a species that do that to each other?

I'll address the following hypothetical - if they are so advanced and know better than us, why don't they just come down and dictate to us what to do, the right way to live, and give us tech to make everything better and easier?

That's simple. A kid learns from touching a hot surface that it will burn them. It's demonstrably true that people actually learn stuff through action and experience, we know that through all the psychological literature we have. And it's not just humans, pretty much all species here on this planet demonstrate this when studied.

I think if a species are advanced enough to figure out space travel, then they are advanced enough to figure that out as well.

Just to state the obvious and preempt some comments, **I'm not stating this as fact -** just that, with the logic I've laid out above, it would be the Occams Razor explanation for the apparent limited encounters we experience here on the planet, given how overwhelmingly likely Scientists believe it is that the rest of the Universe is full of life.

Nothing I've said is remotely radical or crazy - it's just some pretty basic logic applied on a wider level:

a) that advanced civilizations must have a sense of responsibility to be using advanced tech and not having destroyed themselves;

b) we know that it seriously messes up cultures and their natural development when they are introduced to civilizations far more advanced than they currently are;

c) that a+b would mean that advanced civilizations would have some sort of rules or code of conduct for responsibly interacting with species less advanced than their own.

Doesn't mean that they always stick to it, or that it's always been the case, but that's sure how it seems from where I am. It's possible we're property of another species... but I don't want to go down that rabbit hole right now.",s5rgcd,14,,1642383356.0,27,0.71

Out of the blue a v-shaped formation of 3 oyster-looking objects were flying at a surprisingly low altitude. A leader in the front and two escorting it. Same size. It was like 3 VW New Beatles in size. You could see that in their surface they had the typical “curves” you’d see on an oyster’s shell. They produced no sound and were flying straight. We looked at each other just to check we weren’t out of our minds and we both confirmed we saw something very similar, although he described the colors in a different way as I perceived them.

Circa 2 years forward from this event, I saw exactly the same thing with a friend but in a different location within a 50 miles range from the original spot.

618,aliens,Why would aliens so closely resemble beings from Earth?,"This is something that has always rubbed me the wrong way. I believe life on Earth originated from somewhere else in the universe, I believe these same basic elemental building blocks exists throughout the universe and are not at all unique to Earth. In my mind, that is where the similarities end.   


Life on Earth evolved from single celled organisms over hundreds of millions if not billions of years on Earth. But, these mutations are random and only get passed down if they help the creature survive and procreate. We can trace similar features like, having vertebrae or having gills or being a small worm shape or a big gorilla shape to many ancestors where these features developed over time. We know these very familiar features evolved on Earth through random cellular mutation.  


SO, I would expect an alien to be completely unique to their environment, just look how many different ways our planet creates life and we're on the same planet! Why is something so distant and removed so similar? Why do aliens look like the imagination of a cheesy 1940s sci-fi low budget special effect artist?

620,aliens,I have a few doubts about a hypothetical First Contact...," 

Firstly, I have strong doubts about the psychological makeup of humanity as a species. At the end of the day, we aren't biologically and presumably psychologically different from the time before recorded history. For much of that history, we existed in small, tight-knit communities. Sure, we tended to trade with other small, tight-knit communities, but depending on the situation or the individuals involved we also often exterminated them, or at least killed all the adult males and ''absorbed'' the children and females. We are a species of highly cooperative, society based superpredators, rather similar to wolves or wild dogs. And, like wolves and wild dogs, both our cooperation and our intelligence were primarily developed to hunt prey more effectively and efficiently. Going by archeological evidence, our close ancestors, while less intelligent and less society oriented, were already superpredators in their biome and at the top of the food chain. Remember, you don't need large fangs or great strength to be a good predator, in fact a great many such animals have gone extinct even though they were at the top of the food chain. what you need is adaptability and efficiency, both of which are given to you by intelligence.

The thing about wolves and wild dogs is, sure, they let the children and the weakest pack members eat first (and there is archeological evidence to suggest that prehistoric humans took care of the weak members of the ''pack'' in the same way. I use the term ''pack'' to highlight the wild dog analogy, not to suggest we had the same social organization as wild dogs, because we didn't). But they also eat their prey alive. Great cruelty and great kindness in the same package. Incidental cruelty, maybe, but still cruelty.

Now, if we assume convergent evolution and that intelligent life on other planets is still recognizably life as we know it on our planet, then their are two basic measurable forms of aggression in living beings. Proactive and reactive, proactive being cold, planned, calculated and predatory, reactive being defensive, quick-to-the-trigger, hot tempered and typical of prey. Interestingly, a predator is not always more aggressive than a prey animal. Think of say, an american mountain lion vs. a rhino or a hippo. The mountain lion eats only meat, but it will never attack something it doesn't think it can easily kill. Same with wolves or lions. Conversely a rhinoceros eats only plants, but will charge anything it thinks might be a threat, and since they're basically legally blind, almost anything it sees could potentially be a threat. Hippos are simply quick-tempered plant-eating killing machines. Omnivorous bears and chimps are less likely to actively hunt you, but just as likely to attack out of fear.

So how do humans compare? Well, studies have shown that compared to other animals, humans are exceptionally low in reactive fear-based aggression, even compared to close relatives like the great apes. Sure, a human male might get drunk or get spooked or feel provoked into attacking you at a bar say, but usually what is far more likely to happen is, the angry human will either eventually ''cool off'' or wait outside the bar for you with two or three mates and give you a righteous stomping with surprise and numbers on his side. Or, more likely, just go out and have a good time without having to see every other male as a threat.

Because that's how humans operate. Proactive, planned aggression is BY FAR the most common kind of aggression in humanity. We are predators. And what we're doing right now is in my opinion very, very similar to what a predator does when he sees a nastier predator that's further up the food chain. You ignore it and hope it doesn't mess with you.

Will we manage to keep our cool in the face of a technologically superior species? History says yes. I personally think we will. But I don't think our potential downfall will be caused by panic. I think it'll be caused by overthinking. Will we be able to resist making weapons? Even just-in-case weapons? Will we be able to resist planning for war? Will we be able to resist going to war, if not with the aliens, then with each other? Maybe. I'm still not sure.

So that's us sorted. But what about the aliens? Where did they evolve and where were they in their food chain? Did they evolve intelligence to become better predators or better at escaping predators? Well, we know they haven't wiped us out yet, so I guess they see some sort of potential in us. But what are we dealing with here? Can we really say they have our best interests at heart? They may SAY they do, but wouldn't you say the same to a new race you just met? Will THEY panic and start wiping us out if we start making gravity-based weaponry? So far, they've been peaceful, but have they really? They've abducted (kidnapped) some humans and returned them without much in the way of explanation (at least the ones we know about), they've actively jammed our attempts at radar lock at least once for certain (which is considered an act of war), they routinely violate our territory without explanation or permission, generally operate covertly and apparently played around with our nukes at some points. And occasionally aggressively buzz our aircraft.

And their are even darker rumours. At least one USAAF fighter pilot disappeared while chasing one of these things. Was he shot down? Did he try to shoot them down? Soviets claim their Migs tried to intercept and shoot down another craft and got blown out of the sky. Are cattle mutilations a thing? If so, that's worrying, because there are a couple of documented cases of human mutilations, at least one of which carried out with no anesthetic. The victim died of a brain haemorrage. From the pain. Or from a mixture of epilepsy and alcohol, it's tough to be sure. ( For the curious, google Guarapiranga Reservoir Mutilation, but be warned, it's gruesome). All those people just straight disappearing from US national parks, what's up with that?

And what's our political relationship with these guys? Where do we fit in their world? Are we considered part of their empire? A truck stop? A curiosity? Is the alleged attempt in the 1950s to give us their technology + the threat of extermination if we turn warlike an effort to make us useful but weaponless? What else do they want in exchange? Hell, for all we know, they could've been abducting us to use as slave soldiers in some interstellar war. It sounds crazy, but that's what we did not too long ago. Would they be interested in interstellar tourism, guides and all? Would they be willing to pay?

Too many unknowns. We need to have a good solid chat with these guys, face to face across a table, hash it out man to alien. Unfortunately, that would mean the US give up it's spot as the world's ''Preferred Nation'', because everyone is going to want in on this.",s4s0ci,12,,1642274761.0,6,0.69
621,aliens,Theory about UAP colored lights: extreme travelling through a deeply relativistic reality (diagram),"TLDR: [the function of the colored lights](https://i.imgur.com/o1TYD1l.jpg)

------------------
Most of you have heard of general relativity and that when something travels near the speed of light, that time inside the craft will pass slower relative to outside of it, space gets distorted, etc. ([heres an example of such distortions](https://youtu.be/73Mh88wMp3g?t=469)). Now imagine reality is even more relative than we think, perhaps fundamentally relative to an observer. Maybe this involves other dimensions, or timetravel, timelines, etc.

UAP have been observed to perform all kinds of unexplained behaviour like instant acceleration, hypersonic speeds, no sonic booms, time distortions, etc. So probably some kind of extreme travel happens that allows them to travel to places that we cant get to with our ordinary travel modes.

If they use these extreme travel modes and reality is deeply relativistic, it means that from the perspective of inside the craft, outside reality will change rapidly and dramatically. This may be so fast and dramatic that there no longer is any point of orientation or reference as seen from inside the craft. Also, because it is extreme and rapid, slight mistakes may have big consequences, like ending up a million years into the future, or in some far corner of the universe, or inside a planet, or even at an unknown location in the infinity of dimensions. 

**To prevent this, [UAP could do something like this](https://i.imgur.com/o1TYD1l.jpg) (diagram)**

The next 2 paragraphs are a description of the diagram.

Suppose there are 3 craft (A, B, C) in a particular configuration. Craft B remains stationary and emits a specific color of light (like red) at a specific slow pulsating pattern. We call this craft ""the beacon"". Craft A enters its extreme travel mode and will observe that the red beacon (from A's perspective) changes color because of some kind of [doppler effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relativistic_Doppler_effect). Perhaps a blueshift occurs. Also the pulsating pattern changes because of time dilation, and who knows what kind of other effects happen. The unblinking blue color is the signal that the travelling craft has arrived at its destination. At that point craft C will use both the beacon B, and craft A to travel even further ahead. Eventually the beacon itself (B) can use craft A and C as a beacon.

This process can be repeated continuously and enables travel at relativistically calibrated speed, where the exact distance or time or whatever they are travelling through is measured and known. Obviously i dont know what kind of colors are needed, how many craft or the patterns or motion, or what they are travelling through. I just think if reality is really is deeply relativistic, such lights may be needed.

**Which UAP cases display such behaviour?**

The ones im thinking of are the triangle formations with a red light, or the Rendlesham case where multiple craft moved rapidly in a grid like pattern through the sky, changing shape and colors. Here is a quote about the rendlesham craft in the sky:

*""...we have multiple sightings of up to five lights with a similar shape and all, but they seem to be steady now rather than a pulsating glow with a red flash. ... Three objects clearly visible with multiple colored lights on them. The objects appeared elliptical and then they turned full round. All three doing that. They were stationary for awhile.""*

*""... Ten degrees from the horizon... half-moon shape, dancing about with colored lights. Half moons turn into full circles. They move about in sharp angular patterns, very fast. It was very amazing... like they are in formation and perhaps doing some kind of grid search, or doing some kind of pattern, or seemed to be some type of logic to their movement.""*

623,aliens,Discussion: if the future human / time traveler hypothesis is true.,"What are the broader implications for us if the majority of the “aliens” we encounter are humans from one or more timelines or different points in a future?  

Listening again to Ross Coulthart, he speculates specifically that this may be a valid theory that explains why there is so much interest in our world, weapons, and people, as well as the reason for the covert nature of aliens.  He also speculated that is what Elizondo meant with “somber”, that we have a future where we are nearly annihilated with warfare and that news would make us somber.  

Could there be multiple time-streams fighting to  make their future the reality?  Each wanting future events to unfold a certain way? 

If these are future humans, would this explain some of the past “ancient astronaut” theories, but instead of aliens coming here to rule, teach, or exploit the planet, it was human beings doing it to shape the future or steal resources from the past to take to the future?

And on abductions,  could these be people looking for something biological, be it our genes, bacteria, immune systems, or even doing genealogy?  If there are future wars, perhaps radiation damage to our DNA caused problems and they are looking for something specific from an ancestor? 

And of course, the humanoid bodies… listening to Astronaut John Kelly on Rogan, he talks about “what if” we let our bodies evolve in zero G, what would they look like.

624,aliens,The Octopus hypothesis answer to the Fermi Paradox,"Octopus are known for being incredibly smart and capable of complex problem solving and tool usage. However, it's thought that even if they were intelligent enough to develop complex technology that they would be limited by factors like a short lifespan as well as the difficulty of advancing technology under the ocean (ex: can't make fire). 

The latter point regarding technology is another potential reason why life could be abundant in the universe but much life doesn't advance beyond their local planet: many habitable planets may have environments unsuited to technological progress. Humans may have gotten incredibly lucky to have an atmospheric composition that gives us access to cheap energy safely while not posing much in the way of other issues. 

Continuing the ocean example, an intelligent species living underwater would be unable to utilize combustion for energy, would have a a salt water environment which basically corrodes everything, and is a dense environment (molecularly) so movement through it requires more energy as well. There's many more challenges to an ocean environment as well.

Life on other planets trying to develop technologically could face similar problems, different atmospheric compositions, different liquid water compositions/solutions, different gravity, and other factors, which could make technology difficult to progress.",s4l1wz,221,,1642255644.0,86,0.95

629,aliens,Book of Genesis 6:1: Alien Hybrids confirmed or am I reading too much into this?,"I am sure this topic has been discussed intensively before, but I do wonder if perhaps there has been a weaker translation from the ancient Hebrew or perhaps the language used was the best possible description of artificial insemination and/or DNA/RNA manipulation? I speak of the Book of Genesis and the reference to Sons of God sleeping with human women.

The quote...

*And it came to pass, when men began to multiply on the face of the earth, and daughters were born unto them, 2 That the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were fair; and* ***they took them wives of all which they chose****. 3 And the LORD said, My spirit shall not always strive with man, for that he also is flesh: yet his days shall be an hundred and twenty years. 4 There were giants in the earth in those days; and also after that, when the sons of God* ***came in unto the daughters of men****, and they bare children to them, the* ***same became mighty men which were of old****, men of renown.*

— Genesis 6:1–4, KJV 

Now, I do wonder about this: when this was written, the purpose to ""take a wife"" was to produce a family, to continue the lineage. So this may be a reference to human females being fertilized to produce hybrids - as the key objective.

**Mighty men of old, men of renown**: sure, it may refer to powerful children of large stature, but could it also refer to children with great abilities beyond normal humans? With intellect, strength, maybe paranormal capabilities that were far ahead of their human contemporaries.

I realise I am taking a few leaps here, but given how translation works, it may be that the author was trying to convey a description of the supposed alien breeding program (which is sometimes thought of as a recent phenomenon but may be as old as modern mankind) and producing remarkable beings of great powers.

would we not ever send another until we could meaningfully communicate with the inhabitants of that planet? more realitically we'd keep sending probes and gathering data while upgrades to our method of 'travel' were taking place.

what would the inhabitants of that planet think of the periodic light display in the sky?

640,aliens,hear me out here..,"I was doing some light digging on Nicola Tesla after watching the Tesla movie..and I'll add, great flick.

So I decided to look up some of the other ideas and inventions he supposedly made, some sound insane, like...which craft by today's standards, but apparently was able to achieve some of his inventions. I'm not 💯, but apparently he made some sort of vibration device that could shake the surrounding area, a Lazer beam that could destroy a plot of land on the other side of the world...


What if when he died, in 1944,(I think) that these wild ideas were taken and developed by our governments? 

What if that's what we saw at Roswell? what if there weren't ""aliens"" seen, but insinuated based on the tech that was stumbled across?

There's still the ancient stuff that kinda insinuates some ET being here...but what if that stuff is just not the case? What if it's some crazy interpretation from a wild DMT trip from our ancestors?

What if what we're seeing is actually Nicola Tesla harnessing the energy of the universe, and his inventions lived on?

641,aliens,Intelligent life exists not as aliens but as animals. What really differentiates from other earth species is our consciousness.,"We’re quick to discredit the intelligent life of earth as unintelligent because we’re comparing it us, who view intelligence through our advanced lenses of both intelligence and consciousness*

Consciousness could be viewed as the next stage of intelligence. Therefore, we’re not looking for intelligent life in the universe - we’re looking for conscious life.

If there are aliens more intelligent than us, they’re probably more conscious than us too.

Consciousness I guess can refers to a bunch of human abilities such as the sense of self in time, maybe imagination, there’s probably more you could think of.

If there are superior forms of consciousness,  then there are more complex ways to perceive the universe. And in the same way consciousness would be founded on intelligence, superior consciousness might be founded on ‘human levels’ of consciousness.

Could E.Ts not just have a sense of self, but a sense of others? Would one more conscious perceive time differently (is it possible to perceive MORE time?**) Would higher levels of consciousness have greater abilities?***

Just some of my recent thoughts on the matter

* and yeah, we’re probably discrediting other species’ levels of consciousness too. Octopuses and dolphins are two that come to mind as possibly comparable or even superseding levels

** I don’t really understand what that means but I’m just trying to communicate what it would be like to understand it from human levels of consciousness

642,aliens,I Think I May Have Just Figured Out the Fermi Paradox Using The Reality Is A Simulation Theory!,"Perhaps the reason why we don't see any aliens is because they have advanced to the point where they were able to escape our simulation! Let me explain!

Wouldn't a species advanced in the semantics of the universe have a clear and defined understanding of what exactly the universe is made up of and where it came from. Aliens would know we are in a simulation if we were and would try to escape it if it was 100% certain we were in a simulation. Given the hypothetical we live in a simulation the obvious answer is to escape it, unless so we are left to the will of the simulator and their ambiguous intentions. And perhaps that's how they know how to travel at such speeds without friction and breaking the sound barrier, its because they know how to reprogram their surrounding space-time. I believe any species that has evolved to interstellar space travel may in fact be aware of the simulation and will seek to escape it. Therefore we are only left with civilizations that are only as advanced as ours or slightly less or more advanced.

&#x200B;

So the next question is what are those UAP's and here is my next expiations.

I think there are three reasons as to why we still see these aliens that can reprogram their space.

1. The aliens we see were not able to cross out of the simulation and thus look for other mediums to do so.
2. They can cross out and simply cross back into simulations for unknown reasons
3. Those aliens are not from our simulation and have escaped a previous simulation 

That's all I have for now. And I'm sorry if this seems not so well explained I just got this idea 30 minutes ago and Thought it was interesting. Lemme know what you think. Maybe one day we will cross out the simulation as well.",s2o5jw,6,,1642041286.0,42,0.56
643,aliens,Could I be close in figuring out what alien light orbs are after my personal experience?,"**Backstory how I came into the research:**  
One day I was laying in my bed and wanted to grab my phone while it was dark, suddenly there was a small white dot near my face, I was looking straight at it and it looked like white noise. I didn't know what to think of it, like something was looking what I was grabbing and encountered it 3 times in my house. like a floating electricity.

Few weeks later, I tried to find things like people seeing white dots, orbs etc. but couldn't find anything related, only the regular stuff like spirits etc. and left it for a while.  
Since I had a huge interest knowing about aliens, I started to wonder what are these light orbs, I previously thought they were their spirit or consciousness, as the brain is also made of electric light and neurons, which is partly true but these smaller light orbs might actually be spiritual orbs not the bright ones we see in the sky.

**My research:**  
About 1 year later researching a lot of abduction stories and reading books on the topic. I learned aliens, humanoid hybrids or inter dimensional creatures can shift into an orb of light, I'm not talking about spiritual orbs but real bright light orbs we see in the sky flying in formations that science cannot explain.  
I've read in someone's abduction story that an alien told her, you're inside an [energy field](https://www.google.com/search?q=energy+field&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&sqi=2&ved=2ahUKEwjYtpiMtq31AhUxNOwKHVv1DjMQ_AUoAXoECAIQAw&biw=1536&bih=763&dpr=2.5#imgrc=d2It4YwCqPV_dM) no one can hear you. I've also read in a book where alien hybrids were training abductees how to control another human on a spaceship and she was inside what she call a white room but it was inside his energy field, were your body shrinks into the size of a ball. You can also conjoin each other's energy field, could this explain why [larger orbs can pop out smaller orbs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kp4jxRPCaz8&ab_channel=StrangenessVideo)?

I started googling change body into light and came across an old Tibetan religion called [Dzogchen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dzogchen), it seems Tibetan monks were able to change their bodies into a form of light and called it a [Rainbow body](https://www.google.com/search?q=rainbow+body&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiH_qzjq631AhWCM-wKHUxiBmUQ_AUoAXoECAIQAw&biw=1707&bih=859&dpr=2.25#imgrc=D9WZl6F0LPUawM), achieved through deep sleep meditation, also called dream yoga.  
They state through being aware of your surroundings you can wake up from the physical life during your sleep, both work vice versa, and you become the dream which then is your reality, and the output of reality is energetic light if you can overcome your physical reality.

In science it is theorized as [dematerializing into photons](https://marketbusinessnews.com/teleportation-becomes-science-fact-no-longer-fiction/162674/). In that state you can become transparent, like life becoming a transparent holographic simulation build off white energy and our conscious outputs reality through learning which eventually download texture packs as we perceive it, this is probably why some scientist start to debate if we are living in a simulation. During DMT we didn't learned the texture pack of that reality so experience it through our color spectrum.

Could this be close to finding out what light orbs are, does it relate to Albert Einstein's quote '' ***Everything*** *is* ***energy*** *and that’s all there is to it. Match the frequency of the reality you want and you cannot help but get that reality. It can be no other way.*

Nikola Tesla: *“The day science begins to study non-physical phenomena, it will make more progress in one decade than in all the previous centuries of its existence.”*

I'm really in favor of a simulation reality and everything being energy, it connects well to alien their abilities and need for hybridizing into our existence, it's like they are creating avatars in this simulation.

My personal take from this research is, energy or light orbs is turning into your original state of existence which is connected neurons and all is perception or a biological interface like we're living in a Matrix.",s2ll7s,143,,1642033881.0,85,0.81

Please listen to this: all the big companies looking for extraterrestrial life in the universe are looking for planets that resemble Earth BUT, we humans, our bodies, are ""built"" through evolution to cope with these living conditions on Earth (heat, cold, day  - and nighttime, ...) now comes my point: I think that there are many more planets that are completely different from Earth where extraterrestrial life can occur.  Their bodies are then completely adapted to the living conditions on those, for us, uninhabitable planets.  So I think the way we see aliens in front of us is wrong, not the human form with a big head but something completely different.  Let your imagination run wild for that… Of course it’s more likely that there is life on planets that resemble our Earth which makes sense because we ourselves are the proof of that.

651,aliens,Girlfriend's Alien Encounter?,"How goes it ladies and gentlemen? I'm new here, but I figured since I've been sitting on this little ditty for years now I might as well put it out there for your perusal. Enjoy.

A little background information first:

My girlfriend and I had been together for about a year at this point in time (we're still together 16 years later). When she had this experience she had never read nor seen anything regarding alien visitation or abduction, and considering the amount of time we had been together at that point I had never mentioned my interest in same. On this particular night we were spending the night at my father's house, whose property is in a rural and heavily wooded area with very few neighbors. We were sleeping on a pull-out couch bed in his living room, with windows directly in front of us at foot level and above and to the right of the couch position. He also had a very bright sensor light that would come on with the slightest movement of anything walking around outside, which would slightly light up the living room due to the light's positioning on the house. People occupying the house at that time were my girlfriend as well as myself and my father, whose bedroom was at the very back if the house. There were 2 pit bull dogs as well, a male named Bugs and a Female named Piper. Both would get very vocal at any sign of an intruder (barking loudly and pacing back and forth). Now that you know all of that, allow me to describe the incident.

That particular night was very cold (late January in northern Michigan) with a clear, starry sky. I'm a cigarette smoker, so any time I visit my father I go outside to smoke so as not to aggravate his asthma. Just before going to sleep that night I went outside to have my last cigarette (smokers will understand) and as I stood on the porch I was taking in the star-filled sky. All of a sudden something moving across the sky caught my eye, and my initial reaction was ""falling star."" Only it wasn't. This was a solid white light, and it moved across my field of vision from right to left. I thought about going to wake my father to to see what he thought about it, but it quickly escaped my gaze and was gone. Now, as everyone will attest when we see something strange our brains will immediately attempt to rationalize what the eyes just saw, and at that time my brain was telling me that it was the International Space Station I just watched zip through the vacuum of space. Was it, though? Could have been. *Could* have.

I butted my smoke and went back inside, where I kissed my girlfriend goodnight and hugged the dogs (I'm a softy for dogs). My head hit the pillow, and in what felt like record time I was in dreamland. The next morning I woke up feeling like I was hungover, which is most assuredly strange considering I'm not an alcohol drinker. Nor is my girlfriend for that matter. I just felt. . .off. Sluggish and lethargic would be a good description of my state that morning, but I'm a notoriously light sleeper so it wasn't *that* unusual. My girlfriend, on the other hand, had had a rough night it turns out. I didn't get the full story until months later, whether due to embarrassment and her reluctance to tell me or the memories of that night being buried in her subconscious I don't know. But this is what she told me.

Apparently after I fell asleep she was startled awake by a bright white light illuminating the living room, which she said she initially thought was the outside sensor light. Only it wasn't, because as her eyes adjusted to the shine in the room she said she saw three skinny ""people"" standing over the bed and looking down at her with large, black, almond-shaped eyes (think the cover of Whitley Strieber's Communion). She said they had long, slender arms that ended in long, skinny fingers and that all three of them had an odd color about them. When I asked her what that meant she said they all looked ""dirty."" Whether that meant black or gray or brown I don't know. She also said that one was shorter than the other two. Apparently she tried waking me up, but no matter how hard she tried I simply wouldn't. I was out. Dead to the world. She said it was as if I was drugged. She also told me that Piper, the female pit bull, was just as conked out as I was but that Bugs was very awake and barking uncontrollably at the ""people."" But, according to her, he wasn't making any noise. None. Nothing. Not a peep. His mouth was moving and his teeth were bared, but nothing was coming out when the room should have been a cacophony of barks and snarls. When I asked her what the ""people"" were doing she said that they were just standing there, looking. *Looking.* Needless to say she was absolutely terrified at the sight of these uninvited guests standing in my father's living room, but according to her that was when the natural light of the morning sun stirred everyone awake. My father woke up and made coffee, I woke up and let the dogs out for their first number two's of the day and my girlfriend woke up with a whole new outlook on what might possibly be out there. And, you know, quite possibly some repressed memories, but then again I'm not a shrink.

Was it a dream, or did she have an honest-to-goodness alien experience? Who knows, but it makes for one hell of a story.

652,aliens,Intelligent extraterrestrials are visiting us. Now imagine we advanced enough to visit other civilisations…,"We can now pretty confidently say we are being monitored by something beyond our current understanding & it’s quite clear that the technology we are seeing in our skies does not belong to any group/military/country on Earth, therefore we are lead to the possibility that these are extraterrestrial beings studying/monitoring us… The crafts seen by pilots/airforce from almost every country on Earth seem to display intelligence and react accordingly to pilots manoeuvres & even show ability to have intel on the pilot’s missions (nimitz encounter).

Now imagine that we humans advanced to a point of having the ability to also travel to other planets with civilisations of their own… 

Let’s firstly take a look at the North Sentinel Island analogy to help this digest: North Sentinel Island is an Island that is owned by India but inhabited by tribes people who have absolutely no contact to the outside world because it is prohibited by India. Previous visitors to the island by outsiders have mostly ended badly, causing the restriction on travelling to the island. 

The people of the island may wonder, “where are the others?”, but because they are so cut off from the rest of the world, they wouldn’t even be able to perceive that they are owned by a much more powerful & advanced civilisation, which is actually the case. 

If there was anything of interest there, humans would quickly take over the island & take what we desire, but we have enough land to not be interested in their island so it is left be & protected by the Indian government.

If the North Sentinels ever became advanced enough to travel by boat & start visiting other civilisations off their island, they would of course be brought up to speed with international laws & be given their own restrictions on what they can do with their new technology. 

Now let’s apply this to our own situation we have with these visiting UAPs. I think we can all agree that there is most likely not one single species of extraterrestrial who can blip through space given the shear size of the universe & if we are the north sentinels, then these other intelligent species visiting us represent other countries. 

I believe a civilisation intelligent enough to advance to being able to cross spacetime without blowing themselves up first through war & conflict would be a peaceful, well organised & extremely stable civilisation & to achieve this would require strict authority, organisation and cooperation with each other and any other civilisations advanced enough to cross their path. 

It would make sense that us humans of Earth being a far lesser advanced civilisation who have just began technological advancement would certainly be an interest point of any civilisation with the capability of visiting us & they would want to monitor and protect us, just like how India protects the North Sentinels. 

Therefore, if/when we gain the ability to blink through space and visit/find other civilisations, we would be briefed and hopefully welcomed into a galactic federation in place to protect life forms & we would probably certainly not be allowed to just land on another planet and announce ourselves.

There is most likely a scale of advancement to measure how advanced a planet is and depending on the measurement, certain restrictions would be in place. For example, as cameras are invented (most likely a universal piece of technology for any advancing civilisation), landings / flying over populated areas would be restricted.

All of this is just speculation on my behalf but it’s certainly thought provoking to think about.",s1rkfr,86,,1641945485.0,58,0.86

Contact would inevitably cause the current economic and geopolitical structure to collapse.,"The evidence uncovered from my research leads me to understand that the whole UFO phenomenon is kept secret primarily not because of the ""ET"" aspect of it, - although that does scare some people out of their mind, but mainly because of the ramifications which would inevitably cause the current economic and geopolitical structure to collapse; A collapse which is inevitable due to the consequences of the technology related to sustenance, energy and travel.

...

It has been said that Eisenhower rebuked the ""Pleideans"" offer for world peace and abundance because it would ""destroy the economy"". 

I cite the rumors of the meeting at Edwards AFB, fueled by Astronaut Gordon Cooper's many statements of actually being there and filming one such ""arrival"". “Gordon Cooper also stood by his belief that he saw a UFO land at Edwards Air Force Base in California in 1957. Although Cooper had been filming the base with a camera crew at the time, the film, which he handed over to a high-ranking officer from Washington, has never emerged. 

“\[SOURCE: Space.com; “Gordon Cooper: No Mercury UFO” by Robert Scott Martin Staff Writer posted: 06:37 pm ET 10 September 1999\] There are numerous other sources from Astronaut Cooper with these claims easily found if you care to search for them.

There is more evidence to that alleged meeting with President Eisenhower. Henry McElroy, Jr. a former State Representative from New Hampshire stated soon after his retirement, “The document I saw was an official brief to President Eisenhower. To the best of my memory this brief was pervaded with a sense of hope, and it informed President Eisenhower of the continued presence of extraterrestrial beings here in the United States of America. 

The brief seemed to indicate that a meeting between the President and some of these visitors could be arranged as appropriate if desired...The tone of the brief indicated to me that there was no **need** for concern, since these visitors were in no way, causing any harm, or had any intentions, whatsoever, of causing any disruption then, or in the future... While I can’t verify the times or places or that any meeting or meetings occurred directly between Eisenhower and these visitors – - because of his optimism in his farewell address in 1961, I personally believe that Eisenhower did, indeed, meet with these extraterrestrial, off world astronauts.” 

You can see Representative McElroy making these statements here: \[SOURCE: http:// www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrK2YgfjnHo&feature=player\_embedded\], for the transcript go to: \[ HYPERLINK ""http:// www.ufoevolution.com/forums/showthread.php?t=5309"" http://www.ufoevolution.com/forums/showthread.php?t=5309)\]

During this meeting the rumors are that President Eisenhower was presented with the option of receiving all the technological advances available to the visitors, under the condition that we relinquish “our warring ways” and accept the mutual acceptance and equality which this would yield. His reported response was **“That would completely ruin our economy”.**

There are other witnesses who have come forward which verify these accounts, one of which is Gerald Light. “According to him, he was one of four people in the delegation accompanying President Eisenhower, the other three being: Franklin Allen (a former reporter with the Hearst Newspapers Group and 80 years old at the time), Dr Edwin Nourse (the first chairman of the Council of Economic Advisors to the President), and Cardinal James Francis MacIntyre (who was bishop and head of the Catholic Church in Los Angeles until 1970). 

Gerald Light confirmed the “alleged” meeting with extraterrestrials at Edwards Air force base in a letter sent to Meade Layne (the then director of Borderland Sciences Research Associates) on April 16, 1954. In the letter he said “The report is true - devastatingly true!” Light described the event by saying that during his two day stay at the base he saw “five separate and distinct types of aircraft being studied and handled by our Air Force officials - with the assistance and permission of the Etherians!” Light believed that President Eisenhower was planning to make “an official statement to the country” about one month after his letter was written.” 

But as we know, no such announcement was ever made.

[**Dr. Karla Turner**](https://href.li/?http://www.jeffpolachek.com/about-dr-karla-turner) however, holds nothing back. She is fearless and to-the-point.

Turner is the only prominent alien abduction researcher that is also an abductee. This gives her a unique insight into these happenings. Her efforts are not to convince the public that this is happening, but to get to the bottom of why this is happening.

Sobering conclusions are made by comparing data and reports from multiple abductees by Dr. Karla Turner. These are excerpts from her MUFON 1996 presentation:

 **1) We do not know with any certainty exactly what these entities may be.**  
Extraterrestrial, interdimensional, terrestrial in origin, some combination of all the above, something we have yet to dream of. Now, certainly they may well be \[from another planet\] we just don’t know and that's a fact. The aliens themselves have identified a number of different origins to various abductees and contacts throughout the years, but of course we humans have absolutely no way to check out any of the statements they’ve made.

  
**2) At least some of the aliens are liars.** Through the past decades the aliens have made (you know this if you’re familiar with your ufology history) various predictions and promises and given a number of very specific warnings about impending events. And we have these documented at least since the early as the 1950s. …very few of these things and none of great consequence have come to pass. This is not a reliable source. The aliens have also given us a variety of explanations as to why they’re here and why they perform certain procedures. Often however, these explanations are contradictory.—-  


**3) In encounters, the human’s perceptions are controlled as well as the human’s conscience memories.** It is also a fact that the perception of pain can be controlled and is controlled during these encounters… as are feelings of physical pleasure, often sexual pleasure. And of course the human’s emotions are also controlled during these encounters. The fact is you are under control of these creatures during every encounter to some degree.

**4) False memories can overlay and disguise the actual events of an encounter.**  
And even with regressive hypnosis the abductee may recall false scenarios.

**5) Abductees (like myself and so many of you) while we report our experiences, honestly and sincerely we are really reporting alien controlled information to the research community.**  
As abductees our situation is this; we can see the aliens, but we can’t believe them and we can’t believe what we see them do.

**6) There is a serious element of human (military) involvement in the abduction phenomenon, in addition of course to the very real alien participation.**  
It is not alien illusion of military. We’ve got names, dates, places, bases it is real.

**7) Whatever else it may be, the abduction agenda involves quiet physical aims and procedures that tend to belie the idea of a primarily spiritual motivation on the alien’s part.**  
And much of what we see in these procedures goes well beyond the alleged aim of a cross breeding program.

**8) The alien agenda also involves long-term psychological programming of the abductee.**  
It targets one’s social and personal relationships, our sexuality, our political ideas, and our religious and spiritual concerns.

**9) Abductees often go through sexual obsessions, dysfunction and compulsions.**\[Common reports from abductees include\] sperm gathering, egg gathering, fetal extractions, baby presentations and so on.

**10) It is a fact that the aliens show a mysterious interest in the human soul.**

661,aliens,Anunnaki Made AIDS?!?,"So last week, I saw this message (Anunnaki Made AIDS) twice while out n about in Atlanta. First, was on the back of roadside directional signage. While not huge, it was definitely bigger than a 8.5X11 sheet of paper. It was professionally printed in the sense that it wasn’t spray painted or hand-written, and was solidly glued up. Black on white lettering, “Annunnaki” and “AIDS” in larger fonts than Made, each word centered on its own line. Didn’t think much of it; a new band’s advertisement, perhaps?

Saw the message a few days later on the hatchback of a smaller car, again professionally done, like you might see for a business advertisement. Vinyl lettering attached to the glass, large enough to be noticeable from a few cars back. Can’t find any reference to a business, band, belief, website etc. not sure where to post this, and I don’t want to cross-post elsewhere. No phone number or logo/ art accompanies the message.

667,aliens,"Interpretation of aliens, UFO's, and related phenomena","Warning: This is long and might be rambly because I just came off seeing a documentary that's making me question other accounts.

Late last year, I started catching up on podcasts from as far back as early 2020. I listened to Astonishing Legends Terry Lovelace interview, as well as their interview with Stan Gordon on Kecksburg. Both of these really resonated with me and started me on a UFO/alien track. I listened to Lovelace's two Devil's Den books and, while I still don't know how I feel about the phenomena, he seems very sincere and believable. Also I really enjoyed his much more personal story, as well as those he shared in his book.

I also watched both Missing 411 movies and then Amazon Prime pointed me to some other documentaries like Gods Among Us, Being Taken, Extraordinary: The Seeding, and some others. I was very surprised just how much lined up very well with Terry Lovelace's experience. I also just watched Close Encounters of the Fifth Kind with Dr. Steven Greer. And now I have questions, confusion, and curiosity about the entire phenomena.

I don't have any personal experience with any extraterrestrials nor have I had UFO sightings, but Terry Lovelace's account feels way too genuine to dismiss. The part that really hit home for it wasn't the experience itself, but the aftermath, physical effects, and the overall terror of it. Even in some of the stories from other people shared in his second book, those were recurring themes.

What I noticed, in some of the documentaries I've seen most recently, is a real tonal shift. There's almost a joy associated with experiences like Lovelace's. Gods Among Us with Carolyn Cory is a celebration of these experiences, even some that really sound traumatizing. Taking it a step further, ETs Among Us 4 is Barbara Lamb pretty much speaking directly into camera for an hour about how the hybridization experiences are blessings, even some that sound closer to sexual assault than anything. Now that I've seen Greer's Close Encounters of the Fifth Kind, I feel thrown. His ideas of consciousness and summoning aliens is... interesting, to say the least.

I understand everyone has interpretations, and if you're believing the grander claims of this, there are many species that could account for multiple types of experience. I suppose what threw me most for a loop, was a lot of information was lining up pretty clearly and suddenly, the fear changed to desire.

I don't know fully what I'm asking, I guess. This may (justifiably) be down voted because of that, but I'm still left wondering other people's thoughts on all of this. 

What are some of your thoughts? Are there other audiobooks or documentaries anyone could recommend?

Or specific questions: Should extraterrestrial phenomena be viewed as a positive thing? Is the government working with aliens or training us to fear them? Is there really just *one* right answer for all of these phenomena?",s0yy6h,16,,1641860011.0,12,0.87
668,aliens,Was it all a dream?,"Alright, I stay in a small town in Cleveland, Ohio and about 10 years ago. I had a crazy dream that felt so real! One night I was watching TV and fell asleep. I woke up to my tv , still on but it was all static and acting weird. I heard a ringing noise , coming from outside so I looked out my window. And saw a UFO flying in the sky. I watched it fly over top of my house and stopped. I was in shock, as I watched it hover over my house. It was huge! And had multiple colored lights,  flashing underneath it. Then, before I could even process what was happening, I saw the light, from down stairs cut on and heard my brother scream, so loud to the point I was paralyzed in fear. I tried to call out his name but I couldn't speak, I heard alot of movement and saw shadows of two things moving downstairs. 

Then, the next thing I know, I woke up. And my tv screen was pure blue. As if my cable, was fucking up. I looked out my window and saw nothing. Idk if I was dreaming the whole time, or if me and my brother got taken by aliens, that night, but ever since that happened. I've been interested in aliens ever since and have a million crazy stories like that!

A) The alien tree is not part of the earth tree. Alien life arose on a different planet.

C) The alien tree is a branch of the earth tree. Life arose on earth and then somehow spread to the alien planet.

676,aliens,The Deputy Director of the CIA at the time of the Kennedy Assassination is mentioned in the addendum of the Oppenheimer / Einstein draft document.,"I’ve been looking into the **Oppenheimer/ Einstein** MJ-12 document recently. The last page has a paragraph added by **Vannevar Bush** and his thoughts. He discusses Oppenheimer approaching ""**Marshall**"" and wanting to brief Truman. ""Marshall"" rejects the idea and also appears to be in disagreement with the conclusions reached in the discussion paper. Dr. Bush seems to think Truman won’t like the paper’s conclusions either. Dr. Bush also mentions he has discussed the subject with ""**Gordon**"", who also disagrees with Oppy. I am fully convinced ""Gordon"" is **Gordon Gray.**

I initially thought ""Marshall"" was **General George C. Marshall**, who in June 1947 was the U.S. Secretary of State. Doing a bit more research, “Marshall” may in fact be (then) **Brig. Gen. Marshall S. Carter,** who was George C. Marshall’s Chief of Staff in June ‘47. Carter was Deputy Director CIA from ‘62 to ‘65 and then  Director NSA '65 to '69 during the ""peak"" period of U.S. government UFO disinformation projects. A man that was read into the MAJIC compartment after the 1941 crash retrieval, was involved in the immediate aftermath of the 1947 crash retrievals and was therefore well aware of the threat JFK posed to the MJ-12 control power base if he collaborated with the Soviets on the UFO issue. As Deputy Director CIA on November 22, 1963, he most likely initiated the **Burned Memo** directive and oversaw the execution of its contents (as Deputy Directors traditionally do operations oversight). Perhaps Carter was given the Directorship of NSA for ""a job well done""?

The main reason I believe Dr. Bush is referring to Carter is that he mentions Gordon Gray by his first name, and so is most likely using the same first name basis in his addendum to speak to other members of the ""inner circle"" of those briefed into the MAJIC compartment. Marshall doesn't like Oppy's report because it basically calls for an end to all atomic weapons, including halting the development of thermonuclear weapons. Oppy can see the danger posed to the human race once artificial satellites are a reality and loaded with nuclear weapons - ""*since they project war from the horizontal to the verticle plane in the fullest sense. Attack no longer comes from an exclusive direction, nor from a determined country, but from the sky, with the practical impossibility of determining who the aggressor is, how to intercept the attack, or how to effect immediate reprisals*"". Oppy poses the question that the ""***presence of celestial astroplanes in our atmosphere is a direct result of testing atomic weapons?***"" Obviously, Harry Truman would reject Oppy's proposal outright, given the problems he was facing with Formosa (Taiwan) and the Communists in China in June 1947.

Interestingly, researcher Donald R. Burlinson believes this to be the beginning of Oppy’s fall from grace. In his lecture ""**UFO secrecy and the fall of J. Robert Oppenheimer**"" [https://youtu.be/pJY7UYbbKvc](https://youtu.be/pJY7UYbbKvc) Burlinson posits that at his trial for “un-American activities”, Oppy was shocked and dismayed when he walked into the first day of his trial to find **Gordon Gray** presiding over it. Dr. Bush was also part of Oppy's defense, giving evidence at the highly classified, closed trial to attest Oppy's patriotism. After he lost his case, and loss of his Q clearance, Burleson said that Oppy told a reporter that there was a “**story within a story**” relating to his downfall, but wouldn’t elaborate further. Furthermore, the “VB” initials at the end of the addendum do match the known signatures of Dr. Bush.

One more thing - with regards to the Twining White Hot report, another connection I found interesting was that one of the signatories of the report, **Gen. A.C. Wedemeyer**, was also **on the board of NICAP** at the same time as **Adm. Roscoe Hillenkotter.** Maybe he was installed as a “plant” to make sure Hillenkotter didn’t divulge any more of the core secret than he already publicly had?",rzp7sk,188,,1641725725.0,15,0.97

680,aliens,"""Had a tiger by the tail"": Confronting the UFO legacy programs within the US Government.","The above is a quote from 'Skinwalker at the Pentagon', on page 174 on the amazon kindle version.

It is taken from--in my opinion--one of the most important pages in the entire book, and subsequently, is one of the most pivotal data points in our attempt to sneak just a tiny peak at those who possess the most incredible secrets. Here is a fuller quote from pages 174 & 175.

""Sacha Mover and Jim Bell (*probably pseudonyms*) began knocking on doors beyond DHS to connect with the “keepers of the secrets” in at least two other agencies. In these meetings, which took place in **June-July 2011**, Sacha, Jim, and colleagues were treated rudely and harshly. Bell and Mover were repeatedly told “no, and hell no.” **This left Mover and Bell convinced that advanced technology was sequestered under government supervision at aerospace contractors’ facilities.** As a result, the DHS officials became very hesitant and even fearful of moving forward. Perhaps Mover and Bell only belatedly realized the unique, game changing, and earth-shattering nature of **the biggest secret ever kept by the United States.** The vast implications of this secret may simply have paralyzed them.

It’s possible that because DHS was a “new kid in town” and low on the traditional pecking order among long-established intelligence agencies that their requests were viewed as not worthy of serious consideration. After all, with the passage of the Homeland Security Act by Congress in November 2002 in response to devastatingly poor coordination between intelligence and law enforcement organizations seen in the wake of the September 2001 attacks, the Department of Homeland Security formally came into being as a stand-alone, Cabinet-level department to further coordinate and unify national homeland security efforts, opening its doors on March 1, 2003. **Therefore, when Bell and Mover began knocking on doors to obtain additional evidence on sequestered advanced technology, the rudeness and hostility shown to them was not just an attempt to protect the greatest secret of all,** but a marking of the territory for a young organization less than ten years old that dared to request access to something that had been successfully buried within the bowels of the United States Government for more than 60 years.

Nevertheless Bell, Mover, and colleagues emerged from the June 2011 inter-agency meetings newly convinced that **sequestered advanced technology was real** and that they **had a tiger by the tail** in attempting to bring a new BAASS-like program under the DHS umbrella.""

The above is just another piece of a decades old puzzle. There *is* a program that *does* possess crashed or recovered extraterrestrial technology within the United States---it does exist. But is it just the one program, or are their 'factions'?

What many like myself would like to know is, if the program that Mover and Bell had realised existed, which has ""advanced (likely extraterrestrial) technology"", ""sequestered under government supervision at aerospace contractors’ facilities"", the same program from the Wilson-Davis notes, with the bigot list of 'employees' ranging from 400-800 personnel? Is it the same program that General Neil McCasland works for, the same program that he told Tom Delonge had ""found a life-form"", or does McCasland work for a different program altogether, entirely separate from the program run by the 'Gatekeepers' that Admiral Thomas Wilson met, and the program Bell and Mover ""had by the tail""? And what about Timothy Taylor, who is he working for? We know he works for NASA, but is Timothy Taylor a part of the same program of Bell and Mover, or different? Is Tim Taylor's program the same as the infamous Special Access Programs, and is he then on the bigot list run by the Gatekeepers, as revealed by Admiral Thomas Wilson? Is Timothy Taylor working alongside General Neil McCasland in the same unbelievably secret 'organisation', or a different one?

The crux of my questions surround the legacy program(s) within the United Sates who study crashed Extraterrestrial technology and Extraterrestrial biology. Is there just one, super secret, almost monolithic, enterprise that has the highest control globally in regards to the phenomena, or are there 'factions'? Is the personnel on the bigot list international, or just American? Have the possible factions listed above, really just the same group, with people like General Neil McCasland and Timothy Taylor on the same bigot list which was revealed to Eric Davis by Admiral Wilson, and if so, is this program run by the 'Gatekeepers' the same program Bell and Mover ""had by the tail""?

Here are the four potential programs studying Off-world technology and Extraterrestrial Biology:

1. General Neil McCasland's program as revealed by Tom Delonge.
2. The Bigot list run by the 'Gatekeepers' as revealed in the Wilson-Davis notes.

If I have understand correctly the theory of the multiverse, the current thinking is that there are 10 seperate dimensions (although I continually hear that there might be 12 but I will go with Rob Bryanton' explanation of 10) [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ca4miMMaCE&t=416s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ca4miMMaCE&t=416s).

In the 10th dimension we have essentially imagined every possibility of every possibility, an infinite number of infinate possibilites.

Therfore in the process of thought or observation, where you consider a reality with a particular property are you not then creating that reality?

694,aliens,Humanity’s Eulogy,"Dearly beloved. We are gathered here today to lay to rest, Mankind. Humans as they called themselves. Gone too soon with so much lost potential.

Man started simply. As most species do. Just another of this universe’s creatures trying to survive, until one special subject discovered he/she could alter their surroundings to make tools. From there it was off to the races. 

Not soon after making tools from stones they starting using fire to forge their tools into hardened metals and alloys. Just 10,000 years separated those tool makers to the smartphone users of recent. That is an extraordinarily exponential growth. Just 66 years separated the Wright bros first manned flight to the moon landing. Astonishing.

I don’t think anyone can deny the ingenuity of this species. They were never satisfied in large with the ways of the time. They always had a small percentage that wanted things improved. Bigger, better, stronger, faster. Always improving the situation but rarely improving themselves which was their downfall as we know. 

Mankind. Ironic isn’t it? Kind is anything but what they were to each other. Their ingenuity was valuable attribute but they began to turn it on each other, developing more and more weapons of mass destruction. But while the greedy and violent ultimately had control of the planet and led them to their demise. There was the by and large who “got it” as they say. 

I like to think that the true cause of mankinds demise was ignorance. Their speedy growth came with an arrogance and ignorance that one can get wrapped up in. Like any other adolescent, mankind was worried about the here and now over the future. As a result they allowed there leaders to be corrupted and tragically lead them to their very own demise. 

So the question remains. What should they have done different? What could they have done different? Maybe everything, maybe nothing. Perhaps the corruptibility of the human mind and emotional decision making doomed man from the start.  However, what we can say for sure is that mankind’s impact on the world they resided in was impossible to ignore. From the Great Wall of China to the pyramids in Giza. Man was capable of amazing things with limited resources. 

We shouldn’t simply shrug off mankind’s existence as a flash in the pan, but try to learn from it. Remember them when teaching curious young ones. Use them as a cautionary tale not to let their emotions take control. That greed is one of the greatest evils to exists in this universe.

696,aliens,Manifestation is real,"We literally live in a virtual-programmed reality. The universe is a giant hologram of staggering complexity. It constructs reality by taking ""individual"" minds and incorporating them all into a broader field of conscious minds, which then contribute to the broader consensus reality. This means consciousness creates matter and not the other way around. As a result, you can ask this hologram for anything and it will adjust variables like a videogame in order to manifest that specific desire. 

I didn't believe it until I had certain experiences followed by impossible synchronicities. Then I looked back at my life and I can't unsee it. Your thoughts are literally adjusting variables in this universe and molding reality to your desire. I am just a single anecdote, but I am living proof that we are constantly manifesting things whether we believe it or not. 


A lot of people seem to misunderstand what is actually meant by the statement ""consciousness creates matter"". It doesn't mean you alone are some demigod that can create gold out of thin air or that you can literally move mountains (although such feats are technically possible in this universe). It just means desire, intent, and imagination are the means through which this universe self-organizes into increasing complexity. The universe is an engine designed for the production and conservation of novelty (aka unique perspectives, diversity of life) and that as novelty increases, so does complexity. Each layer of complexity mirrors the previous, with every new level of complexity achieved becoming the platform for a further ascent into complexity.

I believe synchronicities are the most obvious indication of manifestation. These staggering coincidences people experience always feel meaningfully connected and that is because they are. When we experience chance happenings, fortuitous events, etc. it always feels like we were in the right place at exactly the right time. This is because it wasn't a coincidence, but rather desire that lead to that particular moment of synchronicity. Synchronicity is simply evidence of the universe adjusting variables to ensure a particular outcome. 

People always be like ""lol if manifestation is real just manifest a billion dollars right now"", but have literally no clue how manifestation actually works. The reason I can't manifest a golden turd every time I take a shit is because of something called ""consensus reality"". Belief (conscious or unconscious) in the broader consensus is the reason our reality appears stable. Most, if not all, thoughts are software programming designed to create artificial limitations on this creative force of reality-shaping that we all possess. The reason reality appears stable even though it is being constructed by our minds is because a single individual will not affect the hologram if their desire conflicts with too many other ""individual"" minds with opposing/different desires. Someone who wants to manifest, let's say, a bunch of diamonds in their living room for example would need to:

A) need to TRULY believe they have the power to do so

B) defy consensus reality and somehow overcome a field of minds whose reality cannot account for such miracles 


As you can see, the more divergent from consensus a particular desire is, the more variables will need adjusting in order to match it, and thus the more time it will take. That said, if it can be done, the universe will find a way. This is why the phrase ""be careful what you wish for"" is so true. The universe will find ANY way to match your internal desire. This means that your desire may manifest in the way most convenient for the Universe but not necessarily in the exact way you expected. From personal experience, this can have some pretty negative unforeseen consequences. Manifestation is a power that should not be taken lightly. 


>“The decisions we make in this moment are based in either love or fear. So many of us chose our path out of fear disguised as practicality. What we really want seems impossibly out of reach and ridiculous to expect so we never ask the universe for it. I’m saying I’m the proof that you can ask the universe for it. And if it doesn’t happen for you right away, it’s only because the universe is so busy fulfilling my order. 

-- Jim Carrey 

If you ever want evidence of manifestation just look into Jim Carrey and his life. What are the chances that the star of ""The Truman Show"" has a life experience that mirrors the plot of the movie, goes on to experience his own spiritual awakening, then later exposes Hollywood and the virtual nature of our own reality? It is ""coincidences"" like this that really make you think.


Edit to add comment further clarifying: 

Also, manifestation does not always mean we are manifesting things that are good for us. You can manifest a reality that resembles hell and not realize it. It is your BELIEF about reality that fundamentally matters most. Someone with social anxiety disorder for example has certain beliefs about themselves and who they are in the world. This person may desire to become a movie star, for example, but if they identify completely with this ego/avatar that they have constructed for themselves, then their desire will be overpowered by that limiting belief. This collection of beliefs and experiences form a self-concept/identity that we call ego. It is this ego/avatar that then reinforces repetitive thought patterns(software) that then put debuffs/limitations on your reality. Your beliefs constrain imagination and thus constrain reality.",rxzzy3,318,,1641534088.0,265,0.84

* If you know of any other resources please put them in the comments!!!!!!!

Basically there is a rumor that an underground pyramid exists somewhere 50 miles northwest of Mt. McKinley. According to Tom Delonge this pyramid is some how suppressing our consciousness and has been studied by the military for decades.

Alaska has been a known UFO hotspot, and there is an area known as the [Alaska Triangle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Alaska_Triangle) where many UFO's have been seen, among other High Strangeness.

Linda Moulton Howe supposedly got the exact coordinates to the location you can check out for yourself: 63.2976110, -152.5234691 (within the Alaska Triangle region as well)

The coordinates are quite unremarkable. Looks like nothing is there at all. No roads or any other signs of human activity. (Just last year [a man went looking for the Pyramid and went missing](https://craigmedred.news/2020/10/27/deadly-attraction/) around the Lake Carey area based on her coordinates, he had a satellite phone and everything, spooky!!)

I figured that if this thing was studied and guarded by the military for years there would need to be some kind of landing strip in the area based on LMH's interview with the son of a military officer who flew there.

I scoped out the area and found exactly what i was looking for and more, just north of LMH's coordinates at Lake Minchumina. Here are the coordinates: 63.90911233657512, -152.30401269384032.

below is a screenshot of the location you may notice something odd on the left right away:

You can clearly see the airfield and a long narrow road that leads to a huge circular perimeter roughly 1,800 ft across. I believe THIS is the actual site of the pyramid, and it is not too far from the original coordinates. If someone can provide a mundane explanation for this please let me know!

**The part that really blew my mind and convinced me i found the right location was reading the** [Wikipedia entry for Lake Minchumina](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Minchumina,_Alaska)**. Here is the passage from the geography section:**

>**""If we were to cut out a map of Alaska from a piece of paper and balance the map on the point of a pencil, we would have found the center point of the physical structure of the state. That point is at 63°50’ N, 152° W. or near Lake Minchumina.**""""**General Mitchell looked at Alaska on a globe. He saw that Alaska was approximately equal distance from all of the major urban-industrial centers of the world.** Figure L.1 is a map of Alaska as seen from space. It is centered on Lake Minchumina in Interior Alaska. Note that we can see the major centers of Asia (Tokyo and Beijing are shown), Europe (Moscow, Berlin, Paris, and London are shown), and North America (New York, Toronto, and Los Angeles are shown). **General Billy Mitchell viewed Alaska's relative location and found that it was, indeed, central to the urban-industrial world.""**

&#x200B;

It's basically saying that Lake Minchumina is at the geographical center point for the urban-industrial world. What better location for and underground pyramid that is supposedly radiating an energy that is suppressing our consciousness?

EDIT: according to a pilot who flew there, the airstrip at Lake Minchumina was was built during WWII so the military could easily fly planes to Japan. There is a direct military connection to the site. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FS-Q0W2kyw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FS-Q0W2kyw)

EDIT 2: WHO'S TRYNA GO TO LAKE MINCHUMINA WITH ME THIS SUMMER? I HEAR THE FISHING'S GOOOOD!

EDIT 3: Just want to highlight some good debunks from commenters can could possibly explain the ring.

* Forest Rings - This phenomena is found throughout the world but is not completely understood by scientists. The leading theory is some kind of Fungal spread that creates a ring.
* Top secret missile silo - a location with a strong WWII military presence that is equidistant from most urban-industrial centers would be a great place to build a missile silo.
* Volcanic Lacuna

EDIT 4: [u/grundle\_salad](https://www.reddit.com/u/grundle_salad/) used an EMAG2 KMZ magnetic anomaly survey overlay on google maps. There seems to be a pyramid shaped magnetic anomaly at the site of the ORIGINAL coordinates. This is fucking chilling.

Things have changed since I was a young child/young adult, I am no longer afraid of them and I will not allow them to keep me in a state of near panic like they used to when I was younger. When I started feeling that familiar sensation, I went to my gun cabinet and pulled out a pump action 12 gauge shotgun and loaded it with buckshot. I then kept it right next to my bed between the bed frame and the night stand. Last night, I woke with the overwhelming sensation of being watched, on instinct I rolled over and reached for the shotgun. When I did, I heard a voice clear as day saying ""You will not need that"" and ""We wouldn't want anyone to get hurt"".

I’ve spent quite some time on this subreddit reading posts on the topic, looking for evidence online etc 

Something just doesn’t quite add up. Out of the hundreds of countries in the world, the focus seems to be on America for revealing what evidence they have.

There’s so many different countries with their own governments and agendas, yet not one of them have come out and said, look this is the evidence, we have found this and want to share it with the public. I’m talking solid evidence, such as physical debris from a crashed ufo. Yes there’s roswell and other ufo crashes that may have occurred. So America seems to have quite a history with ufos. However what about the rest of the world?
Surely it’s not only America that these ufos are crash landing in.

Yet none of the governments from literally hundreds of countries around the world have come out and said yep this is it sort of thing. Here’s you evidence, public take a look.

There’s the theory that all the countries are waiting for each other and don’t want to be the first to say anything as it puts them at a disadvantage. However this still doesn’t make sense as surely there would be one out of hundreds who would come forward.

Maybe they all just don’t know anything and no one actually has any real evidence. I mean if you think about it, would a technology that has mastered space time travel end up coming to earth and crashing because of our magnetic field or whatever? It doesn’t make any sense.

The only thing I’m left with is that no one actually knows much about the phenomenon. They don’t have any physical proof (apart from videos) and that’s why no one is saying anything.

2. a video of a woman who claimed she could see aliens through some kind of portal or interdimensionality. something to do with a telephone pole outside, she could detect some alien energy? the video thumbnail uploaded here was yellowish and the woman was looking through some sort of box or binoculars, or maybe she was just pointing at something

720,aliens,Paranormal Encounter,I’m curious if anyone else here has had what you would consider a paranormal encounter that’s so much physical and that you’re not touching you’re not being taken anywhere that type of a thing. Reason why I ask is because about two years ago I was laying in bed eyes closed dark room and I just got the news that day that my stepfather passed away big-time abuser so I was just laying there with my eyes closed fully awake never sleepy at all and out of the blue I see the shadows coming towards me and I’m laying there I’m just like OK whatever’s going to happen is going to happen and they were at least three gray alien looking creatures and I saw one get really close and my eyes are still closed at this time got really close and then all of a sudden my hyper ventilating slowly a little bit became Calm out of the blue.  The one thing I do want to mention is I can absolutely describe the detail in the eyes which I’ve never seen except on I think it was the Bob Lazar documentary which I sought after this and it was a gray alien but around the eyes was almost like as if you took a Shar-Pei or some like that and shaved all the way down it’s almost looking like not shiny but soft and almost like tiny little hairs around it I don’t know how to describe it other than that dark bigeyes.,rx4r6m,5,,1641441104.0,10,0.62

I'm sure a lot of people were talking about UFOs in 1947 after the Roswell incident. But that fad dies down over the decades with the quickness. What im trying to say with this post is that. Each era had a phase of UFO hype. A phase where it same like everybody and their grandparents were talking about UFOs. A phase where it seemed like society was going to find out what these UFOs were. But then the UFO hype dies down real quick every decade.

 This happens all the time. For like about 50 years I think. There are certain times in history where everybody gets all excited about UFOs. And people start talking about UFOs more often than usual.

The story describes Linda suddenly awake above her bed to see strange figures in the process of levitation. Once on board a craft, she was subject to medical analysis and alien experimentation by different beings, some human in appearance. As her account later gained attention, two men came forward as “witnesses” who ultimately went on to kidnap and interrogate her multiple times, leading Napolitano to believe it was a cover-up.

Linda’s recollection of events, like many before and after her, had deployed critics. In subsequent years since her experiences, medical professionals associated with the case have found that she is of sound mind. Walter H. Andrus, founder and then director of MUFON, considered Napolitano’s story as, “definitely authentic case of human abductions by aliens.”",rwpdek,246,,1641396335.0,93,0.94

And many of you guys just said there is no connection. Just a bunch of people looping anything woo or paranormal together for nothing. So people were basically saying it's just nonsense lol.

But when it comes to missing 411. I always hear people bring up UFOs/UAPs as an explanation to explain why people went missing in these parks or woods. I don't know much about missing 411 cases. Because I'm still new to it. But I heard when people are found. They either forget about what happened before they went missing. Or they refused to talk about what happened before they went missing. And also I heard portals are involved. Again I don't how true all this is. Since I don't know much about missing 411 cases. But I do know somehow people manage to connect UFOs/UAPs to missing 411 cases.

Since 2017 comparison studies have been made as part of VASCO program and scientists identified over a 100 stars that cannot be seen anymore. Most of these could be explained by some natural phenomena, but for missing 9 stars explanation has not been found. Most interestingly, all these stars are located in an extremely narrow part of the sky.

What’s quite unusual is that the magazine and the scientists involved in the project seem to take seriously the possibility that this disappearance is due to an advanced civilization (hypothesis include dyson spheres and very large space vessels in the solar system in 1950).

The idea of a all our war in the sky by alien visitors initially sounds unlikely, however, when you look at the other potential explanations that have been put forward, they also seem equally as unlikely.

I'm not trying to get all Demi Lovato on you guys. But think about it. If I thought a certain race of humans were all really demons. You guys would call me a bigot, close-minded, and racist right? Why don't we imply this same logic to aliens too? I know people here on this sub keep telling me to let people believe what they want because""we don't know the answers yet"". But hear me out, guys. By definition, demons are magical spiritual beings that are also evil and hate humans. And want to possess humans and hurt them. According to the Bible and other religions. So wouldn't using the term demons to describe extraterrestrials/aliens be just as problematic as using the term demon to describe any human race?

Yes, I agree it's fine to let people have their views, opinions, and beliefs in what UFOs/UAPs are. But before you reply to this post think for a second. Let's assume the UFOs/UAPs are aliens for a minute. And also let's assume aliens are these creatures that come from different planets. But a group of humans thinks aliens are demons. And now am about to use an analogy. Gay people are human beings. But some Christians think gay people are demonic or less than human. You guys see where I'm going here. Gay people or other races are analogies for aliens. And calling them demons is analogy discrimination.

The odd thing is this person had what look to be painted white skin, and red lips. During the dream as all dreams weird crap happens all the time, but during the dream I started to feel like something wasnt right.

As I started to feel this way, the person did something to me where I could not move. As I started to panic in my dream and went from not being able to move and started to get my muscles to respond the person literally dissapeared. As I saw that happen I began to say ""someone help me"", it was at that point I woke up with my hand in the air and rising from my bed struggling and saying someone help me. This woke my fiance up and I just looked at her and said did I just wake up saying someone help me? She was to tired to really understand and we both just went back to sleep.

Just wanted to share, maybe see if anyone else experienced anything similiar.

|First post about the alien Dream|

 

Alien abduction or dream ?

I decided to post this after watching a show that described a Mantis looking being . I literally never heard of that type of alien . I am very familiar with what people describe as the greys.

I’ve always been interested in UFOs, space and aliens but that’s all it’s ever been, just an interest .

So about a year ago I had a dream I was back home at my parents in Michigan sleeping in the guest room per usual when we visit . For some reason my dream is me waking up and gradually looking to the door of the room. What I saw looked like an incredibly tall mantis looking thing , just the face I saw . At the same time of seeing this I let out the most terrified scream I’ve even heard, but it only lasted a second . As soon as I started screaming I immediately started to lay back down and basically blacked out . That’s when I woke up . I only had this dream once and it was here at my home in NJ .

Tonight I watched a show on aliens and a person described a mantis being which gave me chills since only time I ever saw that was in that dream .

This is like 1 of 3 dreams I’ve ever remembered. Now whenever I visit my family , I sleep with the lights on ( like that matters lol) and I’m 33 !

I’d be potentially interested in doing reverse hypnosis , but also concerned of false memories or real ones that could really mess with me .

Funny thing is this is the house I grew up in and my 90 year old busha who is a no BS person said she saw a UFO so close when she was young she could see the beings in it. She also swore she saw a UFO slowly go over our home during the day . She lived with us from when I was 10 and just recently died, she never changed her story .

Maybe the similarities in the hallucinations that people experience during trips on different compounds could be explained not just by our chemical similarities but also by us sharing different fragments of that original message that was distorted by eons of evolutionary mutations. 

And maybe like billions of shakespearean monkey typists we could eventually build the genetics back up to find out whatever that original message sent via intergalactic spore said. 

Or maybe the spores were designed to infect our simple monkey DNA and slowly mutate us into that alien species. Or maybe we're just a bunch of random specks floating in a giant explosion by ourselves. Psh yeah right who would think that?

It's difficult but sometimes this puzzle is fun to think and theorize about so I thought I'd throw this out to you all to see if you have any ideas or thoughts that might help bolster this concept or maybe eliminate it. None of this is a wholly unique idea, just trying to find a way to navigate this nebulous topic. 

There are moments in time where we see flashes or flurries of UFO/UAP/Encounters/Alien observations/crash sites/landings. Documented cases some times geographically specific, like New Mexico surrounding White Sands and Los Alamos, just as one example. Or some of these encounters happened as the United States was developing, testing and proliferating nuclear weapons that could be tied to certain milestones of human achievement or dangerous consequences being exerted onto the Earth and perhaps the universe. What if these clusters of anomalous events are no coincidence, and are in fact aliens altering some aspect of our world to influence future scenarios. It could be a massive influence like curtailing a nuclear war during the cold war, or ensuring world war 2 ended the way it did without more of a nuclear arms battle. I have no idea what or how this would happen but this is just to postulate that perhaps instead of the common concept of extra terrestrials, future humans or what have you are here to influence us or control us, *what if they already did?*

If they influenced our world in the past, we would have no idea, completely oblivious to how they've twisted the natural order, perhaps for the better or perhaps worse. Maybe they’ve tweaked something that would otherwise have huge negative future repercussions. And what we’re witnessing now with the phenomenon is simply the checks and balances, monitoring and observations of how this butterfly effect is panning out. Understanding how radiation is making its way into our livestock or humans via abductions, sampling and mutilations. Understanding and observing nuclear capabilities and armaments of superpowers at our nuclear and weapons sites. Their work is essentially already complete here on Earth, their influence felt but we will never actually know what it is. And they’re here for some time to essentially make sure it all holds. Maybe making micro adjustments or continuing to track and monitor for future generations. Because they took this initial action to alter the course of our species, they would have some responsibility and possibly obligated to stay and remain anonymous so their influence doesn’t upset the delicate balance they’ve created. Maybe giving reason why we witness this stealth/cloaked like quality to the phenomena, why we see beams of light from UAP to nuclear weapons silos. It seems undeniable that the phenomena is observing us and has been observing us, this may be one theory to answer why. 

Furthermore, perhaps there are people that are in on it all. Governments that are aware and once they are aware have been told they cannot disclose information or it could tip the scales the wrong way. I’m no government apologist but I wonder if there’s something like once you know you can’t speak about it for some legitimate reason. Perhaps creating more dire consequences, maybe giving credence to the secrecy and shrouded slow disclosure. Maybe this slow drip is a way to curtail the impact somehow. 

I've also seen a lot debate over their benevolence or hostility towards us. In this scenario it's really obsolete. They are simply keepers of order. Indifferent to our general awareness and operate nuanced moves that we can never perceive. Nudging us along a path, or even in this scenario, already nudged for the sake of future humans or other future species in the universe, whatever their motivations may be.",ruq3h2,2,,1641175671.0,2,0.67

762,aliens,With an increased interest in UFOs/UAPs. There are bound to be more sightings reported and recorded by people.,"https://youtu.be/mXLrkVFyWjI

Of course, this is common sense here. The Government confirmed UFOs/UAPs were real like 5 years ago (2017). Therefore gives people a lot of time on their hands to get interested in the UFO/UAP topic. Like Lue Elizondo always says. Everybody has a phone nowadays that can record stuff. And everybody always keeps their phone around. Therefore reported sightings more often.

But don't get too excited yet. With more sightings come more mundane sightings too. We are going to get 4 times the balloons sightings, bird sightings, drones sightings, or whatever random sighting by civilians. Bigger numbers are just going to increase the already existence bad things or errors about UFOs/UAPs sightings.

So there is a good and bad side to this. The good side is that we have more normies, civilians, and average joes interested in the UFO/UAP topic. Therefore more people putting in the effort to record sightings that's a great thing. But the bad thing is that normies, civilians, and average joes are going to have the same previous problems with trying to identify stuff in the skies like birds, balloons, and drones. Like they usually do. The only difference is that this problem is going to increase with bigger numbers at play.

But I will admit some people were kind of right about one thing. That thing being our conscious will change. Technically speaking people are more aware of these UFOs/UAPs now. So I guess the state of people's consciousness was affected somehow. Even if a bunch of humans are still going to get stuff wrong. I will still take that as a win though.

In conclusion

I just think more people are interested in the UFO/UAP topic now. Maybe not the whole world yet. But I still believe a lot of people are.",ruc0w2,10,,1641137744.0,2,0.71
763,aliens,We could not be too sure about our origins,"There's a lot of speculation that the human race was engineered or bred or in any way created or tampered with by someone or something, like extraterrestrials, aliens or any kind of gods.

But with our current state of science and technology, we have a very little chance of being able to check and confirm such claims.

Imagine a race of advanced otherworldly brings, who reveal to us that we actually were DNA-manipulated, or imported from another planet, or even designed from scratch by these beings. How could we reliably test this? With our current state of science, there is no chance.

Hyper-advanced races could feed us with virtually any narratives, even going as far as providing some evidence. But if they are millennias more advanced, they could possibly produce any evidence they want in a snap.

Like, they don't even have to inject some ""proof DNA segments"" info every single human, they could probably just project this into our minds en masse. Or to just implant this acceptance into everyone, like it was always a fact.

Imagine an alternative reality, where humans can communicate with ants primitively. Humans could say to ants that ants were created by humans 100 years ago through DNA manipulation. There is zero chance ants could have knowledge about what they were 100 years ago and have absolutely no idea what DNA is and for sure a lot of ants would think that the higher beings told the truth.

765,aliens,"Long post, but worth it. Using basic social science, I'm going to explain why UFOs are ignored and why UFOs appear to be mocking us."," Status seems pretty central to the UFO phenomena.

For example, reports have been filled on well over 100K encounters worldwide so far, but most of the books & movies on the topic focus on the same few cases. These cases are chosen in part for having more witnesses, detail, and physical evidence. But they seem especially chosen for having prestigious witnesses and locations. Seen by police or military workers, especially pilots. At military bases, especially housing nukes. These same books and movies are most eager to interview sympathetic people who are very high status, such as heads of state.

Similarly, many ancient legal systems had formal rules relating status to whose legal testimony to believe. And the social status of witnesses matters greatly today in court, even when there are no explicit rules requiring this.

Apparently most who witness UFOs as part of their job don’t report them, fearing reputation consequences. Because UFO fans are widely seen as very low status, at least among cultural elites. Similarly, organizations like police, militaries, airlines, and airports don’t want to be associated with such events, and so discourage reports by members. Unless some outside monitoring system discourages it, such orgs probably simply destroy such reports when they can.

When high officials have been asked privately why they would be reluctant to publicly admit to UFOs, they consistently say that the public rewards them for projecting ability and knowledge re their topic areas. UFOs require them instead to admit that they don’t know, and that there may be other parties around far more able than they. This effect is larger for police and militaries, compared to other agencies. And it is largest for the United States, at least during the period when it has been nearly the world’s dominant military power.

Status effects may even help explain some key features of UFO behavior. For example, among humans today, the response to an aggressive physical attack usually depends on how strong is the attacker relative to the defender. (The strengths of both sides’ allies are usually included in this calculation.) When the attacker is much stronger, the usual response is submission. And if they have similar strength, then the defender is likely to react vigorously.

However, if the attacker is far weaker, like a toddler attacking an adult, the usual response is to signal one’s strength by easily deflecting the attack, with little harm to either side. And in the reports I’ve read, this seems to be the usual reaction of UFOs to human attack: easy deflection. Which seems to signal their awareness, intelligence, abilities, and status stance. Maybe they sometimes let us seem them just so they can dis us in this way.

Status effects might even explain their lack of communication. (If they exist, of course.) Often small nations are eager to “enter into talks” with big nations just for the status bump this gives; “they take us seriously, and include us among those who must be consulted”. Conversely, the ultimate status dunk is to refuse to talk to or about someone; you act as if they are as worthy of this as a gnat. Might this explain the otherwise-puzzling lack of direct communication from intelligent exotic causes of UFOs?

A perhaps related and more ominous possible reason for their lack of communication is that they expect this to lead to us asking them some awkward questions. About our history, their expectations about us, their previous behavior toward us, their future plans regarding us, etc. Often the simplest way to avoid having to answer awkward questions is simply refusing to talk. Maybe how they plan to treat us reflects their view of our relative status, and we might not react well to hearing this.",ru8mrt,20,,1641126323.0,6,0.73

Many religions teach that God separated himself into trillions of aspects to experience himself from all of these viewing points. After going down a rabbit hole of research into reincarnation, I am now fully convinced many religions are getting at something very real - that we are all emanations of a singular higher-order Universal Mind.

Out of all the theories on what happens after death, reincarnation has the most evidence. In fact, some of this evidence is actually impossible to deny. All evidence seems to point strongly towards the notion of samsara - a cycle of endless death and rebirth, with the soul acting as a save-state for recording these thousands of lives.

You have to be so deeply entrenched in the materialist framework to not find the evidence convincing. I really don't understand how scientists have managed to ignore this for so long. It is literally the most important subject we could be investigating. Finding out what happens after death has deep implications for the nature of our Universe and the nature of consciousness. It may very well elucidate the most important question of all - not how the Universe works, but why it exists in the first place.

This video summarizes some of the evidence.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La8vG4mA0is


For more evidence Look up Dr. Jim Tucker, Dr. Ian Stevenson, or watch surviving death on netflix. If you want to go a bit more woo, read the book Journey of Souls by Michael Newton.

Dr. Tucker documents thousands of stories of children who claim to remember previous lives. In almost every single case the children reveal details that indicate knowledge that could only be obtained through personal experiences - aka knowledge only someone who lived a past life could know. You can claim it's only anecdotal evidence but when you get thousands upon thousands of these bizarre cases, the anecdotes start to look pretty convincing.

For example look into this case:

>A 3-year-old boy in the Golan Heights region near the border of Syria and Israel said he was murdered with an axe in his previous life. He showed village elders where the murderer buried his body, and sure enough they found a man’s skeleton there. He also showed the elders where the murder weapon was found, and upon digging, they did indeed found an axe there.

There is no accepted explanation for this phenomenon. Dr Tucker has suggested reincarnation through quantum mechanics. Ultimately no one knows, but it clearly suggests reincarnation plays some role in life.

In short, this seems to indicate that our reality is ontologically monistic expressed through the universal medium of information, and is an emergent property of the universal substance comprising reality – consciousness. We all share a single mind that fractals into smaller units of consciousness which we incorrectly perceive as unique and individuated entities. Souls are the universal mind/consciousness creating fractals of itself in order to create new perspectives. An all-encompassing mind would need to do this in order to learn about itself. In its original pure omniscient state, this mind would have nothing to do and nothing to learn. In order to solve this dilemma, the Universal mind must split itself in order to create the allusion of otherness.

This universal mind acts like an AI learning algorithm, with the soul acting as a save state for these thousands of lives. Since we are all emanations of the same Universal Mind, souls do not need to be created, but instead, it is a process of this Univeral Mind splitting itself into individual units of consciousness. Creating individual units of consciousness with no memory or awareness of the nature of their divinity allows for an infinite number of units of consciousness, all contributing new perspectives with diverse modes of being. All information is integrated at a higher level. These experiences are all being simultaneously observed from a level of reality that exists outside of spacetime, and then later integrated into the higher-order emergent single experiential self – the Universal Mind. 

Since we find fractals everywhere in nature, we can naturally deduce that the concept of the soul would exhibit similar phenomena. Presumably, this mind could fractal infinitely, and thus an infinite amount of ""souls"" can be created. We find self-similar fractal systems are everywhere in Nature. The ubiquity of fractals throughout nature seems to point to the idea that reality is rendered by computation and that we live in a holographic virtual programmed reality where the concept of self is completely illusory and we are instead nothing but avatars for this higher-order all encompassing mind.  This is explained best by the following. 

>In computational reality, we are freewill non-deterministic meta-algorithms, or software, running on the hardware of the larger consciousness system. We all are part of this fractal multiversal structure, co-creators of our own experiential reality. This fractal multiverse is running on some kind of ultimate code, a meta-algorithmic language of Nature based on binary code and fractal geometry, the code which allows syntactical freedom of expression, and is transcribable into subjective data streams, observer-dependent perceptual realities. Naturally, we are fractals of the larger universal mind, which in turn, is a fractal of the larger Omniversal Mind. Evolutionary emergence and progression through levels is the name of the game, “Return to Eden” is our ultimate goal, and the ""unreachable"" endgame of evolution is the Omega Singularity.*
mind creates dimensional reality out of dimensionless bits of information projected from the Omega Singularity. This Universal Mind, is the sole ontological source.    

-- Alex M. Vikoulov

Edit to add on comments I made in thread: 

If our consciousness survives death then clearly there is some immaterial aspect to reality that ensures the continuity of consciousness across multiple lives. This would seem to confirm the existence of deeper layers of reality and the soul is embedded within this deeper information layer of reality. This implies that our brains are receivers of consciousness and that consciousness is produced from elsewhere outside of spacetime by the soul. In other words, the brain is a reductive organ, not a productive one. It functions to dampen broader realities, functionally confining conscious experience to 3D+1 spacetime. Anyone who's ever taken a psychedelic drug understands that there are broader layers of reality separated by thin veils, but ultimately accessible during altered states of consciousness, aka removing the brain's reality filter and opening your awareness to a broader reality just barely out of reach. I don't see how you can explain the existence of the soul if consciousness is not fundamental.

If matter arises from consciousness and not the other way around, then there must be a universal mind. Consciousness as the fundamental force structuring reality necessarily implies the existence of some emergent higher-order Universal Mind. How could consciousness be the fundamental force structuring reality and NOT exhibit higher-order emergence? As above, so below as they say. If consciousness is fundamental that means the Universe is conscious. Plain and simple.

769,aliens,Should we be careful about what we invite into our minds?,"I’m new to the metaphysical aspect of ufology. I call it metaphysical because while physics may end up explaining everything, it doesn’t yet. I have been inwardly, and intensely opening myself to an experience - hoping that it would be a positive one.  As our species continues to study and be exposed to the Phenomenon, it is becoming abundantly clear our consciousness plays a vital role; perhaps our intentions as well. As I left for a New Year’s Eve gathering last night, a steadily burning orange sphere with some kind of delta wing structure and steady red lights flew slowly towards me and over my house. The object went over the tree line and disappeared. 

I have a background in military special operations, and I am an amateur astronomer. This was not a helicopter, Chinese lantern, or drone. It’s very quiet where I live and the object moved in total silence. Things almost got more still as it passed over my house, between 500 and 800ft in the air. (I also am a fairly good judge of altitude from years of jumping out of airplanes). The lights were a completely strange configuration, and unblinking. I felt like I was being observed. 

While I want a closer encounter (which I am sure will occur at some point), my question is this: can this exercise of invitation be dangerous?

771,aliens,"Could there be a link between climate change, UFO technology and the sudden push for disclosure?","I think most of us could agree that the Govt and powers to be agenda's have shifted in recent years. 70 years of cover up's and denials have changed to public acknowledgment of UFO's and the acceptance that what we are seeing is ""beyond our current understanding"" and more than ever the thesis of some being of extraterrestrial origin is  being taken more and more seriously. 

But a big question now is why? 

Assuming that the govt has been reverse engineering UFO tech for decades, which I believe they have, could the rapidly changing environment be the reason for the sudden push, in an effort to introduce zero point energy to replace fossil fuels, and change the way we power the earth, before we push the climate past the point of no return? 

We already know that Co2 levels in PPM are rising faster than they did following the impact that eventually wiped out the dinosaurs, we know that the next mass extinction event is already well underway - the weather seems to be changing year on year, I'm in London and all week it's been 15°C, in the middle of winter, it gets warmer every year. I saw a post on reddit earlier and hundreds of people commented, expressing that were seeing noticable yearly changes and temp rises all over the world, and unheard of weather patterns for the respective area's. 

So maybe it's happening far faster than they predicted, and know that our technology needs to change within the next 'X' amount of years to still be able to reverse climate change, before we hit zero barrier so to speak. 

But you can't just introduce advanced technology out of the blue, a sudden result of years of black ops and reverse engineering programs, ones that you relentlessly denied existed. You have to introduce it slowly and in a way that makes logical sense to the public, hence the increasing disclosure, and now a new program exists, with the intent to study and understand UFO technology and behaviour, and to raise funding to try and re-create and reverse engineer it - their way of eventually being able to publically release this technology plausibly, just without the public knowledge that they have been developing it for 70 years.

Perhaps it's not actually DNA, but perhaps it's something similar and this is a good reminder that we should keep our eyes and minds open to all possibilities. The evidence is definitely not in the rock or ground beneath our feet, is one main point Lue tries to make.

Here's my transcript beginning from around 40:51:

Lue says, “Let me ask you this as a scientist. Curt, if I said to you, Curt, you have a task. You can make it out of whatever you want, any material you want. Your goal is to… in a million years… You have to create something now that will last 1,000,000 years. To prove you were here. What would you do? How would you do it? You’d find some type of hard material that would outlast just about anything else on earth, right?” \[Curt says basically that he'd use whatever’s the hardest material. And put it in orbit.\] Lue says, “Hopefully non-retrograde orbit. Here on earth it’s really hard to make anything that lasts more than a few thousand years. You can even make the pyramids and look at them now and say, ‘wow those things are 5,000 years and they don’t look so great, and probably in another 5,000 years they’re not gonna look good at all’ and they might last eventually until a hill of - you might have a hill of sand in 100,000 years but that’s gonna be about it. And that’s made out of rock. Mount Rushmore same thing - it’s gonna be gone in 10,000 years you won’t probably even recognize it, it will be too worn. Even mountains, in millions of years, become deserts. Right? Time moves on. Then you have the subduction zones on earth that eventually, if you wait long enough, on the surface of the planet, it all gets recycled anyways. It’s all gonna get sucked down in the mantle and get spit out the other end as new land. So nothing’s indelible on this planet. It’s constantly changing. And to create something that can last the sands of time so-to-speak is a lot harder than one might think. The few examples we have here on earth that are man made, you can look to the pyramids, you can look at things like Stonehenge, but that’s a blink of an eye. Those were just made a few thousand years ago and they’re not gonna be around for a whole long lot of time. That’s just not the way earth is. So if you’re trying to find some sort of marker, chances are you’re not going to find it buried in the earth unless it only happened maybe the last 5,000 years ago or so. Right? Even some of the most dramatic examples of terraforming. Let’s look at for example the meteor impact crater in Arizona. It happened 60,000 years ago. That’s already filling in. In another 100,000 years from now you might not even know anything ever happened because of the processes of earth and what this planet does. It’s constantly erasing what’s on the surface. It’s constantly burying what lies beneath deeper and deeper and deeper until eventually it gets recycled. That’s a hard question. What would last long enough for us to go back and say wow this is an indicator of alien life on this planet 100,000 years ago. What would you have to do to achieve that? To accomplish that? It’s a lot harder than one might think. And then again, would you recognize it? One might say DNA. DNA is a perfect example. If you wanted to do something that was enduring for humanity, that we could look back 100,000 years ago and say yes, that was absolutely manipulated by an intelligent life form. Well, DNA may be one way you could do it. You can put coding and sequencing in there that will perpetuate over time and time, and yes you’ll have some degradation over generations, but in essence you could do something that way. And basically, it’s a biological marker. Right? So we have to be careful when we say we look for evidence. Because evidence isn’t just necessarily a spearhead found in the Big Horn Mountains from 11,000 years ago. It’s not necessarily a pyramid sitting in the middle of a desert. It could be far more sophisticated than that. You said put it in orbit, right? Well, what if we put that, rather than in orbit, we put it into a human body?”",rtuoho,55,,1641077122.0,31,0.88

782,aliens,My first OBE was also what I believe to be an encounter,"This happened to me a little over a year ago, but I haven't shared it with many people because of how insane I felt at the time. But I figured this community may have some insight on what happened to me because well, it's safe to say it's been a very.... interesting year since this.

So, I'm a hedonist; I enjoy baths. I'm chilling (partially reclined) in the water when suddenly the most bizarre feeling comes over me that's hard to describe. It's like I subconsciously knew I was about to black out, so I grabbed hold of the shower curtain so I didn't sink underwater, and then everything went dark.

I felt intense vibrations through my body, and then felt myself 'lift' out of myself. My vision was limited, and saw only brief flashes of imagery flooding my thoughts. The most clear thing I managed to see, or what made its way into my vision, was a blue skinned, reassuring looking being wearing white clerical robes, reaching their hands out to me. Looked like what I guess some people might categorize as an Arcturian? I ended up drawing my own artistic interpretation of what I saw [here](https://www.instagram.com/p/CHo0xu2Dorz/?utm_medium=copy_link). There was what felt like a flow of energy throughout what I suppose was my astral body, before the sensations faded and I went back into body.

I had no idea what the fuck actually happened to me, or how much time had passed, but when I came to I felt very... refreshed almost? Like this ET gave me a quick soul cleanse before peacing out? The only way I could describe the sensation, overall, is that my mind/soul/astral/etheric body was taken out, blown into like an N64 cartridge, and then put back in.

I did get pretty freaked out though later though, wondering if I'd had a seizure and was hallucinating or something. It was a mental state unlike any other one I've been in. Pleasant yet bizarre. 

Now that I've learned a bit more, I've realized that was probably an OBE (and I can see how that can overlap with epileptic disorders as well). Even if this was all in my head, it felt significant.

Can anyone offer some insight on this experience? Did I get abducted in the astral to get a quick purification? Or was I just blacking out in the bath while hallucinating vividly lol.

1. raw/ new planet. Grunts/ asteroid movers steer icy asteroids to it to seed it with water
2. water planet. Finishers/ biologists seed it with organic life, and fine-tune it for evolution and colonization. Going to need to create the seeds for lots of fossil fuel to help the colonies.
3. civilized planet. Greys/ foremen interact with intelligent humanoids to control the direction and production of civilizations for the humanoids' colonization efforts.
4. Post-humanoid planets. Alien engineers begin work on a highly sophisticated and technological planet after successful colonization and stock-piling of necessary raw materials. Maybe there are a few humans still left to operate mines and factories.
5. Finished products. The engineers have completed their assignment and hand over the product to their leaders higher up in the administrative hierarchy. The creator is the top dog of that hierarchy.

Or, it could be some technology being controlled by life. Either or, *I want your explanation to how you think this thing works.*

I did a lot of searching and have found other people including another person on reddit in my same city with the same exact experience.

I was in bed with my girlfriend. I woke up in the middle of the night to a ""black mass"" spread out like a sheet inches away from my face. It was spread out over both of us, over a king size bed. I instantly launched my arm at it to point at it, in a state of shock. The part I pointed at, instantly avoided my hand. It was at this point, it started consolidating, moving up towards the ceiling. I shook my girlfriend up and told her to look. I noticed that she sat up and froze, staring at it with me. It moved slowly. It look like a unique state of matter. Like a fluid / dense gas like appearance. It did not appear like ""smoke"" and seemed to have some type of ""membrane."" It was very dark, but still transparent. In some places it was more thin, in some places more dense, it just depended on how it moved around. I remember seeing a faint, dim orange glow in one part of it. It moved up to the ceiling, spreading itself out, like an octopus. A appendage formed out of itself, like it was reaching out, and the rest of it followed that part and it seemingly slipped through into the vent and vanished.
 
This was in South Texas and it happened many years ago. I asked my girlfriend what she saw, without telling her anything, and she described exactly what I saw. Other people have seen this exact thing. In fact ""black masses"" have been reported for a long time.

You don't have to believe this and I'm not here to debate. I only want your explanation of if this was life, what do you propose it might be made of?

On October 21, 1978, Frederick Valentich, a 20-year-old Australian pilot was flying from Moorabbin to King Island, the trip was supposed to be with his fiance but she couldn't get away from work early and never made it in time. 

At approximately 45 minutes into his flight, Valentich reported to ground control that he could see an unidentified object that was flying faster and higher than he was. 

Ground control in Melbourne confirmed that they knew of no other aircraft in the area and that nothing was showing up on the radar. 

Valentich described four lights, that looked like landing lights on the object and that it was long and metallic in appearance. 

Shortly after a signal disturbance appeared to happen between him and ground control and communication was lost, that was the last time anyone heard from Valentich.

These highly complex technical challenges require a multi-disciplinary approach of systems engineering supported by deep science.

Sandia’s foundation is science-based engineering, in which fundamental science, computer models, and unique experimental facilities come together so researchers can understand, predict, and verify weapon systems performance.

807,aliens,More info on Twining at Roswell and the resulting Counter Intelligence Op,"As a follow-on from my last post, I have some further information. Thanks for u/greatbrownbear for continuing the thread here:

Counter-Intelligence Corps / Interplanetary Unit Report

[https://majesticdocuments.com/pdf/ipu\_report.pdf](https://majesticdocuments.com/pdf/ipu_report.pdf)

(referred hereon in as CIC/IPU)

&#x200B;

1. Why was the head of Air Material Command (based at Wright-Patterson Airfield) in New Mexico in early July 1947? Twining was at Sandia Base to attend a course regarding atomic weapons, as the airfield was home to the 509th Composite Unit. (Fact Vs Fiction Pg. 134)

&#x200B;

2. Why was Twining fielding questions from reporters, per the Oregonian article? 

[https://imgur.com/a/i7hlEpy](https://imgur.com/a/i7hlEpy)

The commanding officer of Roswell up to 8 July 1947 was lower ranked - William H. Blanchard, who at the time was a Colonel. (Fact Vs Fiction Pg. 165). Twining was told to STFU by Brigadier General Roger Ramey, head of the Eighth Army Air Force in Fort Worth, Texas, who quickly pronounced it a misidentified weather balloon. Unusual for a Brigadier to countermand a Lt. General? It was probably coming from Lt General Hoyt S. Vandenberg, Deputy Commander in Chief of the Air Staff. Following the division of the United States Department of War into the Departments of the Army and the Air Force, Vandenberg was designated the Vice Chief of Staff of the United States Air Force on October 1, 1947, and promoted to the rank of full General.

&#x200B;

3. Col. Blanchard ""goes on leave"" on 8 July 1947, replaced as Commander Roswell Army Airfield by Lt. Colonel Payne Jennings. (Fact Vs Fiction, pg 105).

&#x200B;

4. Page 5 of CIC/IPU says Vandenberg limited comms from airbases. Interestingly, this report was re-classified in 1960 by the authority of Allen Dulles - the ""Top Secret"" part is crossed out and the word ""MAJIC"" is stamped across it - indicating the MAJIC classification is either above top secret or in an entirely different classification altogether (like an Atomic Energy Commission classification because of the propulsion system?). The dissemination limiting marker, ""Ultra"", remains intact though.

&#x200B;

5. Major Jesse Marcel was in the Intelligence cell at Roswell Field in July 1947. Major Sheridan Cavitt (later Lt. Col.) was in the Counter-Intelligence cell at Roswell but didn't report to Blanchard. He reported to 700 CIC in Bolling, Colorado, and was taking orders from them about the incident. (Fact Vs Fiction pg. 165).

&#x200B;

6. Fact Vs Fiction report page 134 has the order sending Twining to the 509th and is dated June 1947. The same document also has Vandenberg's appointment diary for June 7, 8, 9, 10 which chronologically lists all of Vandenberg's meetings and phone calls during that time. Includes call from Col. Hackett from Oregon, as detailed by the Oregonian newspaper article. (pg 145).

&#x200B;

7. Fact Vs Fiction pgs 145-147 also lists several meetings/phone calls with Stuart Symington, who at the time was Assistant Secretary of War for Air. On September 18, 1947, the Office of the Secretary of the Air Force was created and Symington became the first secretary. Symington had a stormy term as he worked to win respect for the United States Air Force, which previously had been part of the Army. He had numerous public battles with Secretary of Defense James Forrestal.

&#x200B;

8. Symington is an interesting figure - a close friend of John F. Kennedy. The CIC/IPU report pages 5 and 6 details that the Counter Intelligence Corps learned that Congressman John F. Kennedy was leaked information about Roswell from someone in the Office of the Secretary of the Air Force - most likely Symington himself.

&#x200B;

9**. The key thing here is that if any ONE of the Majestic Documents turns out to be real, they are ALL likely to be real. The massive can of worms this then opens up therefore is that the Burned Memo will also likely be authentic - meaning a group of unelected government officials successfully organized the assignation of the President of the United States to keep the truth from the general public.**

808,aliens,"In August 2021, my mother encountered a UFO.","It was around three in the morning when my mom was woken up by what sounded like someone had pulled into our driveway. She said at first she just thought it was someone in their car with their music up loud, but when she stepped outside, she said that hovering up in the sky, was a craft the size of at least three pickup trucks.

She said that the crafts engine was a loud pulse, and that she could feel the ground vibrating underneath her. She said that she cannot remember the exact specifics, except that it was octagon-like in shape, had red, blue, and white lights emitting all around, and had what looked like landing legs coming out at the bottom, along with thrusters. On the front of the craft were glass windows, she could not make out any silhouettes looking through them. 

Another interesting thing she mentioned is that the craft was able to hover in the air completely still, no movement whatsoever. She said that it sat hovering in front of the house for about three minutes before revving up and flying away. She said that the revving sounding like a helicopter taking off. As it headed off it looked as it was heading for the mountains.

We live in a very rural part Oregon right on the boarder of California and a lot of crazy shit happens out here, but this is definitely the strangest thing that I think has happened. Though my mom is an alien believer, she does not think that this was alien craft.

I haven't been sure what to make of this whole story so I finally decided to make a reddit post about it. What are eveyones thoughts. I am completely baffled. My Mom has offered to do a sketch of the thing later, so if she does I'll add a link to this post of it.",rrq5oq,170,,1640831770.0,64,0.94
809,aliens,Planets with extreme Orbits like Pluto how would we calculate a alien civilization or races age?,"Do we calculate based on Earth age? Or do we calculate based on there Planets time it takes to orbit the Sun? 

Been thinking about this a lot. Pluto for example takes 248 Earth years to orbit the Sun to equal 1 Earth Year. On Earth 1 year=365 days. If a Alien Civilization exists on a Planet with such a long duration of time how advanced could they theoretically could get?

America is 245 years old.

It takes Pluto 248 years to = 1 year. 

In 245 years we Americans went from Horse and Carriage to Nuclear power Stealth Fighters, and Battleships, internet, walking on the Moon and Mars via Rover tech. That’s all within 1 year. 

Aliens on other Planets could be centuries older yet in there time be only 5 years old. And that’s assuming they could live up to modern Human age range of 77+. Which 77*248=19,096 millennium. Which that is a age I can’t even imagine. 

What would tech be like if Humans had this much time to think and create? Well I believe it would take the form of Pure Energy. That can go from Air, Land, Space, and Water without losing Speed. And Yes I am trying to calculate in the normal 25, 40 hour work week to. 

Also if you live on a Ice Rock like Pluto with extreme temperature changes your tech would naturally evolve to suit the Environment. And then if you go to a Planet like Earth well you would look like Gods to us.",rrp6ck,5,,1640828951.0,5,0.78

811,aliens,400 other planets similar to earth at this moment in time... being caller number 400 for the big alien revelation.,"40 billion goldilocks planets colonized in the milky way

10 billion years of colonization

That equates to 4 planets per year.

All the really cool stuff on a planet happens during the age that we currently live in. Humans have had the electric grid for the past 100 years.

So, in any given year, on average, the aliens will need to monitor 400 planets experiencing the electric grid phase of their existence, scattered about the milky way.

It doesn't seem as if the alien over-lords, need too many space ships and crew to handle this many planets. The fewer the better. Maybe it's just one crew, and given 365 days per year, that would average out to approximately 1 visit per year, given a single crew.

Maybe it is just one crew, and it spends it's time managing so many planets and doing important alien stuff, that it doesn't have time to visit earth too often. The whole conversation about an alien revelation sooner or later is dependent on a crew with a very busy schedule, trying to coordinate the timelines and destinies of hundreds of other planets. Remember, humans are here on earth, colonizing the planet for aliens. We work for them, and need to accommodate their schedule.

812,aliens,In the future (and let's be real more like 30 years from now or some shit lol) will we look at our species and people as a collective whole against other people's/species out there?,"So a bit of a loaded discussion.

Essentially what I'm asking is that growing up and playing Mass Effect or watching really any alien Sci fy about humans in some galactic government a common theme is the idea of each species having any issues internal against eachother being erased with the only true societal problem being each species having love or hate with eachother. In humans this would mean conflicts of race, gender, nationality, sexuality, and so on almost entirely erased in favor of us as a collective whole.

Would this actually really occur? Are Earth rights movements going to be a thing? Although I am hopeful of humans in comparison to aliens potentially going positively it's still gonna be a bumpy road regardless initially.",rrjhek,2,,1640813876.0,12,0.6
813,aliens,I feel like this sub is divided into two camps and I am curious where most of us stand.,"I am just kind of curious were most of you stand when it comes to extraterrestrials. 

Do you believe that aliens exist on other planets but have never visited earth because you believe that the distances and time for travel between stars is nearly impossible to achieve? I also believe this group may or may not believe that other intelligent humanoid life exists and that life on other planets is limited to animals, plants and microbes.

Or are you of the believe that aliens have/are visiting earth now and interacting with some humans including the government? Do you believe that it is possible to make communication with these beings in a meditative state?  If  you do fall into this camp do you believe that they are peaceful or that they are demonic or even a mix of both? Do you believe that they speak telepathically and that they can read our minds all the time? 

I don't know if anybody here knows me through my past comments made in this sub, but with all the material between the books I have been reading between abductions stories, hypno regression therapy and the stories I have read in other subreddits such as r/Abductions, r/UFOs, and r/wecomeinpeace I definitely place myself in the second camp.  I believe every human is capable to unlock certain abilities with there mind, I believe that aliens are taking people and running experiments some for a good cause and some for a cause that comes off as a negative and terrifying experience.  I believe there is a group of extraterrestrials that upset at the way we have treated the planet and used nuclear technology to destroy and pollute. I believe that there are positive and negative beings out there, I mean why wouldn't there be our universe is made up of positive and negative energy.  The reptilians always seem to get a bad rep but I believe there could be a positive group of reptilians out there.  I mean we have this with humans, good and bad people so it only would make sense. 

Maybe I am missing a whole other group of believers that believe something else entirely if so please say so, I am just curious where people stand on the subject. Also lets be civil here no need to demean others for what they believe.",rrix4i,5,,1640812447.0,25,0.86

816,aliens,"Imagine an encounter with extraterrestrials who don't communicate with us and are truly incomprehensible to humans, what would the consequences be?","If we came into contact with an alien civilization and couldn't get any kind of communication or information out of them at all, or couldn't even recognize them as a lifeform as we know it, what would we do? 

I've been thinking about what it is that humans recognize as intelligence and sentience, how we often struggle to define that in Earth animals even if they have complex behaviors. I've also been thinking about the weird gray area in biology that viruses inhabit, sort of straddling the line between being living things and inert forces of nature, and wondering whether it's possible for life to develop in ways that we can barely conceive of. Could a complex organism / ""civilization"" develop from this same kind of biological strangeness?

Imagine that an alien spacecraft arrives at Earth and doesn't respond to any attempt to communicate and has all kinds of odd behaviors - starting and stopping seemingly at random, moving around without any kind of rational sense, proceeding down to the surface while ignoring every attempt to get their attention. And then the beings that come out are in a form that we barely even recognize as life but look more like benign objects that wander around aimlessly, never respond to attempts to communicate, aren't particularly animated, and just don't seem compatible with human senses at all. 

How would we handle something like this? I think some people might wonder if the beings we met were living at all but were instead some kind of robotic probe and weren't actually the aliens at all. Others might grow fearful since we can't know their intent and might be inclined towards violence. Others might actually grow bored and stop caring about them since they seem benign and uninteresting.

A weirder thought is how we'd handle an experience like this if they just packed up and left and we never found out where they came from, why they came to Earth, or how they found us. Would this shift society in large ways? Would it just become an odd footnote in history that we move on from? Would it discourage attempts to find alien life? Would it encourage us to explore the cosmos more rapidly?

I have never seen pictures like these, then I went to google and they were all right there. I feel like growing up I never saw pics of impressive crop circles. My first thought when I saw all of these images of these hundred foot long designs were are these messages? In the same way that we can find drawings in caves that show that certain people were aware of the constellations at a certain point, we could maybe also be seeing universal messages in these crop circle.

819,aliens,"What's the point of saying disclosure is happening soon when [""you""] or other people think the Government is never going, to tell the truth? And also what's the point of making up disclosure too?","I always hear disclosure is happening soon in many communities when it comes to the UFOs topic. I may be new to this UFO/UAP world. But I know dam well the saying ""disclosure is happening soon"" is a saying used for decades since the first UFO sighting lol. The saying ""disclosure is happening soon"" is like Christians saying the "" we are in the end times, Jesus is coming soon"" saying. I'm just saying this saying (no pun intended) just sounds like a cop-out.

And also we have to define what disclosure is. Of course, this is obvious to most people who follow this topic. But when this disclosure happens ""soon"" (lol) in the next 80 years. What is being disclosed here? Are balloons being disclosed, are Russians being disclosed, or aliens being disclosed? But anyway I'm not getting the ""what does disclose means"" conversation. Because I'm sure most of us know what is being talked about when the word disclosure is mentioned when the UAP topic is being talked about.

So let's move on and talk about the lack of trust in the Government. This is the main question in the title. If you or others think the Government is hiding things from the public and doesn't want the world to know. Then what's the point of saying ""disclosure is happening soon"" when the people in charge of disclosure wouldn't disclose anything in the first place lol?

Now I'm going to move on to the other saying here. But this saying is still related to the first saying in a way. Stay with me here guys. The saying ""disclosure is happening soon"" is annoying every time I hear it. But the phrase ""disclosure has already happened, just open your eyes and look at the sky"" is much more worst and freaking excruciating to hear every time in UFO-related communities. This saying is like a cop-out for a cop-out. When the ""disclosure is happening soon"" saying doesn't work. The next best thing to it is to just say ""disclosure has already happened you are just blind"".

We get thousands of UFOs/UAPs sightings reported a year. By the lovely civilians who get their understanding of UFOs from movies and Demi Lovato, civilians we can trust more than trained Pilots (Sarcasm). Most of the sightings turn out to either be balloons, birds, drones, and a combination of people just seeing shit in the sky. So it's going to take more than opening my eyes and looking at the skies lol. Now, do you guys see my problem with this saying (""disclosure has already happened you are just blind"")?

Honestly, I believe this saying ""disclosure has already happened you are just blind"" was made to enforce the ""you can't trust the Government"" narrative. So you have to make disclosure happen on your own. The saying ""disclosing is happening soon"" fails because we have no idea how and when disclosure is going to happen. And on top of that even the people who say this saying don't trust the Government either. So the phase is pointless


In conclusion

I think both of these phases are pointless and cop-outs. One is too dependent on vagueness or feelings. And the other one is way too dependent on random personal testimonies with no evidence.",rrf3fb,17,,1640802891.0,12,0.8
820,aliens,"The atom, the vaccuum, and the aliens on the other side. Thought provoking discussion.","A vacuum has the powerful force of attraction, the more of a vacuum or empty space you have, the more energy wants in, the more powerful of an effect occurs.
What if the strong nuclear force Is a strong vaccuum/anti matter that becomes trapped inside of atoms? The atoms can no longer squeeze together anymore. Of course every atom is different so there would be different levels of force vaccum in every bundle of atoms for example there would be more of a vaccum force in a heavier atom like uranium.


 When the vaccum force starts to become too ""strong"" for the atom for example too many neutrons pushing together, it releases the energy in the form of radiation, therefore expelling the neutron making it more stable? This would explain why there is so much energy in splitting atoms like certain neutron dense isotopes of atoms. As you break the atom, everything wants to violently fill the vaccuum, causing an explosion of energy. This could explain the big bang. 


The universe was a singularity unto the most powerful ""vaccuum"", it's complete opposite. Now two things need to collide to give birth to creation. What if our universe was one force, one thing, that met with it's opposite? The two forces eventually caved in, we started from the outside, our universe being like water going down a drain, building pressure and squeezing itself in.. filling the ""void"" which rapidly created a giant explosion of a growing universe and everything we know. Our universe being like a growing baby or seed in the womb, and the vacuum as the womb.

Continually this gets stronger. Our ""universe"" of one, pouring in from the outside, continually growing more complex while pouring in faster and faster, as the womb gets larger and larger. The womb, or the shell around our universe, explodes/grows faster the bigger it gets. This is why there is a point that no light can reach us.
Maybe one day there will be no more nutrients on the outside of our shell, the growth will slow, and then the 🥚 will break, revealing a 🐔 chicken. Or maybe since there is no more expansion, the universe as we know it will slow, and then collapse in on itself like a powerful black hole from the forces of gravity, becoming a single point. Then the void that surrounds us, falls back into us, creating another birth of a universe. Breathing in, and out, over and over.

Could it be, that we are a power source for another system? Just as we penatrate the atom, something else could do the same to us. Watching the results. Their systems learning from everything that happens. It could be that the birth and death of our universe could be the equivalent to our second in time to their universe. Every answer they could ever want could be right within their version of the atom. Maybe, we can do the very same with our atoms one day. As above, so below.👽",rrd9qo,10,,1640798344.0,29,0.75

A few minutes later I felt as if someone was in there with me like you know when someone is walking behind you or etc just feeling the presence of another person. That’s what I felt. So I turn around and no one is in my room, I turn back around close my eyes and hear cracking?? Like when you pop your knuckles and all of a sudden a terrible vivid  image literally flashed in my head and I sprung my eyes wide open and turned around. About 30 minutes later pass and I need to get to bed bc I have  work in the morning so I turn off my light (this is where she fucked up) and I remember laying back down looking at my tv and seeing something move in the corner (it was a super dark corner between my closet and door behind the tv) so I Tell myself your eyes are playing tricks on you. So I continue watching tv as I was watching tv I felt soo sleepy like drained all of a sudden as If I ran a marathon and I just couldn’t keep my eyes open anymore it happened all so quick. Finally I gave in an remember having a literal thought while asleep like “dang my body feels heavy! And I’m so thirsty” Like I’m sinking in my bed so I try to open my eyes but they felt so damn heavy! I felt so sleepy and I couldn’t move my body just my head and eyes and even that felt like doing the most. I opened my eyes and lifted my head up and see this outline this figure of a man shoulder all the way down to the legs but it had no face or features it was just a outline full of static standing in front of my tv and I thought maybe I was still sleep so Shake my head and open my eyes even wider to see him still standing there. I tried to get up but couldn’t move and then all of a sudden I got that super sleepy feeling again my eyes got heavy but this time I tried fighting it off bc what even is that ! But I just couldn’t I fell right back asleep for what felt like a few moments then I woke right back up wide awake drenched in sweat and mobile this time. I jumped straight out of bed and my body felt so sore I was all groggy and super thirsty, so I walked into the kitchen to get a drink and when I was standing at the counter I seen that SAME outline of static literally look around  the corner (walking into the kitchen) at me! Just poked it’s head around the corner! I was too frozen to walk back to my room I just knew it was gonna be around that corner so I stood in the kitchen for like 3 minutes and decided to head back down the hall (we have long dark hallway) and while I was walking down the hall I felt that same presence behind me right behind my hair.

The next day the story was shifted to weather balloon.

A [high res scan of the legendary front page of the Roswell Daily Record](https://www.thevoicebeforethevoid.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/1947-July-8-front-page-Roswell-Daily-Record-newspaper-RAAF-Army-Air-Field-Captures-Flying-Saucer-On-Ranch-UFO.jpg) newspaper contains a second article on the front page, which in my opinion is just as important within the context of the events.

The article discusses another piece written by the Portland *Oregonian* from the same day titled, ***""Air Force General Says Army Not Doing Experiments""*** (you can see the second RDR article in the bottom right of the high res scan linked above):

>Portland, Ore. July 8-- The Oregonian said today that **Maj. Gen. Nathan F. Twining, chief of the AAF material command told it flatly that the ""flying saucers"" are not the result of experiments by the armed services.**  
""Neither the AAF nor any component of the armed forces had any plane, guided missile or other aerial device under development which could possibly be mistaken for a saucer or formation of flying discs,"" **the newspaper quoted Twining as telling it by telephone from Kirtland Army Airbase, Albuquerque. N.M.**  
It continued its quotation: ""**Some of these witnesses evidently saw something** **but we don't know what we are investigating.""**  
Meanwhile, air National Guard squadrons flying from Portland, Boise, and Spokane bases patrolled Pacific Northwest skies late yesterday, landing after sundown without observing any of the objects.  
Col. G. Roberts Doddson commanding the 123rd and 118th squadrons said camera-equipped planes would take the air twice daily from three fields.

[Gen. Nathan F. Twining](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nathan_F._Twining) was a significant player in early UFO history and author of the famous [Twining Memo](https://www.altereddimensions.net/2016/twining-memo-1947-letter-us-general-roswell-confirms-ufos-are-real) and the alleged MJ-12 [White Hot Report](https://majesticdocuments.com/pdf/twining_whitehotreport.pdf) to President Truman. Check out this [recent post](https://www.reddit.com/r/aliens/comments/roj9qs/the_us_military_appears_to_have_used_a/) from [u/Harry\_is\_white\_hot](https://www.reddit.com/u/Harry_is_white_hot/) to go down the Gen. Twining rabbit hole. Their post suspects the Twining Memo was disinformation sent to allies due to M16 being fully compromised by the Soviets at the time. The true White Hot Report was sent directly to Truman explaining the full situation. Both reports were sent within days of each other ( and a few days after the CIA was established).

I personally had no idea that General Twining himself was in the area during the Roswell crash situation. Kirtland Army Air Base was essentially equidistant from Corona, the final crash site, to Roswell Army Air Field. I bet if Ol' Officer Wilcox had originally called Kirtland instead of Roswell we would probably know nothing about the events of the Crash.

You can read about a more in-depth written experience on the [deviantart post](https://www.deviantart.com/ryanwc/art/The-Visitor-of-22-902028097). While he is the most memorable, he was also the most believable considering how he reacted. It seemed like I was looking at a sentient being.

I don’t care if you think i sound crazy, but when I win the powerball lottery, know and understand that it is only because ET exists and that’s why I win in a future date from now. I will use this money to fund a mission to locate and document the “proof” that does exist here on earth. I generally know where to look, but don’t have the means. If I elaborate further I’ll just seem crazy right now, so I’ll wait until I win, then explain how it all happened. 

This will happen in the future, not certain when. 

My mission is:
- To preserve and protect this planet earth
- To protect innocence 
- To Bring Disclosure 

I will:
- Only keep 7.5% of winning $$ 
- Be transparent financially, and with findings
- Use money to fund this mission to locate this “proof”
- Use remaining money to help protect our planet 
 
I will NOT:
- Enrich myself from any extra privileges I’ve been given 
- Use my privilege for fame, or greed
- Do anything that puts innocent lives in danger

839,aliens,Religion and Aliens,"Just some thoughts: 

Please don't accept this as gospel as I'm not 100% on my research.

If aliens were found on Earth, the world's main religions would be hit hard. One circulating story is that a Vatican official met with an alien. The story started with a tabloid newspaper called National Enquirer saying that an alien had been found and that a Vatican official had met with him. Here is some of what was said: ""A Vatican astronomer admitted Thursday that the Vatican had received top-secret messages from outer space – and was trying to decipher them."" 

&#x200B;

The astronomer, Monsignor Corrado Balducci, a high-ranking prelate who works in the Vatican's observatory, said the Vatican had called him in to translate the signals. The observatory's giant radio telescope had received. ""I am convinced that they are not from this Earth,"" Balducci said of the messages, which he said were decoded using computers. Balducci said the messages were sent from the star system Zeta Reticuli and suggested they might have come from a planet called Penimon. ""They are looking for us, and we are looking for them,"" he said. ""We have been expecting to receive a message from outer space. The biblical prophecies tell us that it will be sent by angels,"" Balducci said. ""This is a message from the angels,"" he added. The Vatican has spread the story, who claim that the story was completely accurate. 

&#x200B;

Following the initial story, here is what was said: The Vatican has confirmed that it has received a message from outer space but declined to comment that it is from an alien civilization. The Vatican's observatory received the message at the papal summer residence in Castel Gandolfo near Rome, home to a radio telescope. The observatory's scientific director, Brother Guy Consolmagno, confirmed that the message had been received but said he could not comment on its contents. The National Enquirer, which claimed to have interviewed Consolmagno, said that the message was from the star system Zeta Reticuli, about 39 light-years from Earth, and contained information about the planet Penimon. The newspaper said that the Vatican had been searching for a signal from extraterrestrial intelligence for 15 years. ""We are not alone,"" the newspaper quoted Consolmagno as saying. ""The message is decoded. We are awaiting a reply."" The newspaper also said that the message was received by radio telescopes in Russia, the Vatican and China. 

&#x200B;

842,aliens,I experienced something (after seeing something) in the Adirondacks,"I am not telling you I saw or was visited by aliens, you will have to draw your own conclusions, but this will always stick with me.

For background, I own a Skywatcher Esprit telescope (very high end for the average person, but astronomy holds a special place in my heart) and about 6 years ago in the fall I brought it on an extended stay in the Adirondacks.

One night I had it hooked up to a monitor as I like making long exposure time lapses of constellations. While I was setting it up I noticed on my monitor what I thought was a satellite (light fluttering, moving fast as hell, too high to be a plane). I then was manually tracking it on the telescope, trying to get a better look at it and more in focus; until I noticed the light on it shut off, and it stopped moving entirely.

With the light now off, it looked like a piece of glistening metal rice, simply hovering in the same position in the night sky. It then dropped like it was falling out of the sky until it was out of focus/view.

I was absolutely enamored and kept looking for it the next hour or so before packing it in.

At a loss, I left my telescope and monitor on the covered porch (it's more like a sunroom, I can close the shudders on it to protect my equipment).

That night though I could not shake the feeling of being watched in my cabin, I even closed the curtains from paranoia.

Around midnight, I awoke to what seemed like an absolutely torrential wind lasting about 5-6 seconds. I panicked thinking about my equipment and ran outside, only to see it exactly where it was, intact and all.

I soon noticed after my panic something was very off though, all of the dried leaves and brush around the dirt driveway and near the porch was entirely cleared out, as if someone took a leaf blower to the dirt driveway and front yard area, even dirt from my driveway wound up in the yard.

All of the other brush and dead leaves surrounding my cabin were untouched and undisturbed.

The practical side of me thinks it could've been a weird random gust, but that still leaves so many unanswered questions.",rq7di3,103,,1640667759.0,19,0.94

844,aliens,Credibility of David Jacobs Hybrid/Hubrid Narrative,"I am relatively new to ufology. I came across this interview between Art Bell and David Jacobs in which he makes the following claims that seem to be echoed by John Ramirez and hinted toward by Luis Elizondo:

1. There is an active program that has been going on since the 19th century where UFOs abduct human beings in order to create “hybrids” and”hubrids”. This program entails abductees being taken 400+ times per year and David claims he has met thousands of people that have been abducted this many times (even saying this is a hallmark of a real abductee)

2. Hubrids are grey aliens bred with humans and the beings are indistinguishable from us aside from the ability to manipulate the minds of other humans

3. Hybrids are grey aliens bred with humans that do not look human

4. UFOs are basically breeding labs and/or nurseries for hybrids and hubrids and there is a routine set of medical procedures done to humans that mainly for us on the reproductive system.

5. Although hubrids look exactly like us, they lack basic understanding of human culture/etiquette and are therefore partnered with and abductee that trains them to act more like a normal human being

6. The hybrids, hubrids, and greys are controlled and follow orders from an insectoid alien species 

7. Although the motivations of the insectoids are unknown, it is clear that they have invested significant time into invading out planet with clandestine hybrid and hubrid operatives that we have no ability to defend against. These operative have the ability to manipulate our minds directly and do what they want with impunity 

8. David has come to these conclusions only after he hears the same information from multiple abductees. And the information above is consistent across thousands of interviews.

Obviously this is very far fetched and the real answer is somewhere in the middle of all of this. That being said, between David and John Mack, it is clear that there is an abduction phenomenon. And also clear that John Ramirez thinks there is hybrids and Louis Elizondo things there is genetic manipulation of our species.

Where do you guys think the grain of truth is in all of this? What David portrayed is somber and sobering…

848,aliens,Unprecedented UFO mandates for Pentagon-Intelligence Community signed into law,"# UNPRECEDENTED NEW UFO LAW ENACTED

For the first time ever, Congress has enacted explicit and sweeping mandates to the Pentagon and the Intelligence Community regarding how to deal with UFOs-- signed into law by President Biden today (December 27, 2021) as part of the massive National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA, S. 1605).

&#x200B;

The unprecedented UAP-related requirements are sometimes referred to as the Gillibrand-Rubio-Gallego provisions, after the lead sponsors in the Congress.  The detailed legislative provisions authorize, among other things, fast-response field investigatory teams and a ""science plan"" to analyze data on UAP.  The new law also requires the regular transmission of detailed UAP-related information to key committees in Congress (much of which will be classified), as well as annual unclassified public reports that must cover at least ten enumerated subject areas.

&#x200B;

For much more detail on the new law, why some proposed provisions didn't make it into the final bill, information about some of the officials who are likely to oversee the new enterprise, and ongoing related developments, please see my detailed article, ""Congress Tells Pentagon and Intelligence Community: UFOs Are Serious Business!,"" at the link below.

849,aliens,Intra-government factions or unity with UAP research: who actually has the crashed crafts?,"It is a strongly held belief by many people who have researched the UFO/UAP phenomena that the US government, and perhaps others, have crashed UAP ""debris"" and ""crafts"" that are heavily associated with an Extra-terrestrial Hypothesis in terms of origin, in their possession.

But who really knows where these ""exotic materials"" are kept, and where do they come from, is it one group or many? I will describe briefly below, three possibly independent USGov programs studying UAP, or perhaps they are all from the singular program and follow the same chain of command and leadership. With these three cases below, I understand, that this sub-community already understands very well and will require little background. 

1) The infamous Wilson-Davis notes are believed by some researchers to be evidence that some kind of US military/government/private sector program is studying the material evidence of the UAP phenomena in an extremely clandestine manner. The program consists of 400-800 people on what was referenced as the ""bigot list"". This bigot list was headed by three individuals who described themselves as ""the gatekeepers"".

2) Tom Delonge has arguably done more for the UAP subject than anyone, and a kay aspect of the revelations about the phenomena that Delonge has divulged, was his introduction of General Neil McCasland to the public. McCasland is a retired four star general that was the head of the Foreign Technology Division at Writ Patterson air force base (How foreign was the technology he was studying?). McCasland is purported to be, or at least was, the head of the/one of the US government's UAP Program/s.

3) Diana Pasulkas 'American Cosmic' introduced the invisible college of the 21st century, the 'UFO Fight Club' to the world. Tyler D, or Timothy Taylor, a multi decade long NASA employee was revealed to study the UAP phenomena in a highly secretive, very wealthy, entrepreneurial academic research group she titled the 'UFO Fight Club'. Taylor even believed he was in contact with non-human intelligences who send him telepathic information about advanced concepts which he turns into multi-million dollar inventions. Tim Taylor has supposedly presented Chris Bledsoe's case to the Pope, Obama and Trump. 

So, does Timothy Taylor, General William Neil McCasland and the Three Gatekeepers all work for the same shadowy group who actively study crashed UAP crafts in their possession---Technology not of this Earth, not made by Man, not by Human hands---Or do they work for different factions within the USGov and for some unknown reason(s), they work independent of each other; with separate security apparatus', different leadership, different funding, etc...? If they are separate, are they aware pf each other? And if they are aware yet still work separately, why so? 

&#x200B;

I'm probably way off, but I think it is something like, McCasland is working with the same group that was headed by 'The Gatekeepers', who actually have the Roswell and other crafts, whose modus operandi is national/word security, etc... and Tim Taylor is from another group who works on the more spiritual side of the phenomena, but yet is still keenly involved in the technological aspects of UAP.

Would really love to discuss the above. Hope it was coherent.

855,aliens,What the James Webb Space Telescope might reveal,"We've had some notable astronomical events in the last few years, and two really really stand out -

1 The Oumuamua object (constellation Lyra)

2 The strange light dimming of Tabby's Star (constellation Cygnus) consistent with a large increase of mining activity (as one explanation)

And either one of these would be interesting enough, but for the fact that they both come from the same general area of the sky, especially as Oumuamua's exact origin can't be calculated with precision, *its origin is quite possibly consistent with the location of Tabby's star, or they could be connected in some way.*

If this James Webb is pointed at polar North this would to my mind be an intriguing target for it to check out.

Let's look at what the scope does, and why that might be relevant -

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James\_Webb\_Space\_Telescope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Webb_Space_Telescope)

>the JWST will observe in a lower frequency range, from long-wavelength visible light through mid-infrared (0.6 to 28.3 μm), which will allow it to observe high redshift objects that are too old and too distant for Hubble to observe.

 The mid infra-red looks like its ideal to detect technological signatures such as of the Dyson sphere sort, and maybe examine for watery planets.

If space industrialisation is occurring around Tabby's star and it's recent, it might suggest expansion.

Why is industrial mining considered an explanation for the strange dimming of Tabby's Star? This thread examines this;

Highlighted above, dust from asteroids is a current potential explanation for the increased magnitude of dimming around Tabby's star, which could be due to possible mining, and this would be visible in the wavelength range seen by the James Webb Space Telescope.

*Where we are in relation to the calculated origin of Oumuamua and Tabby's Star;*

Tabby's Star is in the northern constellation Cygnus.

[https://www.pinterest.co.uk/pin/441000988505949768/](https://www.pinterest.co.uk/pin/441000988505949768/)

We are rotating around the galaxy in that direction along with the stars there.

This region of the sky is in the general direction calculated to be the source of the Oumuamua object, which has some error range in it. Oumuamua is thought to have come from very roughly the position of what is now the star Vega in the constellation Lyra

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%CA%BBOumuamua](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%CA%BBOumuamua)

Oumuamua has been deaccelerated in a very odd way - that is, that everything else should be rotating about the galaxy centre at roughly the same speed in the same direction but the object that was tracked travelling through the Solar System was acting as if it was at rest relative to us and the other stars in our spiral arm, so we are actually travelling to it.

So its fun to speculate, maybe there is an interstellar civilisation spreading in that neighbourhood. 

Oumuamua itself could have been something like a telescope that was sent out to investigate useful candidates for mining. The Tabby's Star could perhaps be a home world or a colonised solar system being mined (1500+ years ago) and in the early stages of exploitation. If this is the case, and it is their home world, then they have only recently started exploiting space for minerals, since in the time observed they seem to be saying that the light anomaly is increasing, and that if by mining, then they have yet to exhaust these resources. However if Oumuamua was connected, then it would have been sent earlier as its motion is slow by comparison to light.

Operating under the assumption that he and his cohorts have been leaving both intentional and unintentional breadcrumbs for the community to find, you can discover some absolute gold nuggets to many aspects of the phenomenon.  This post may reveal one of those nuggets.


You are highly encouraged to dig deep into and re-watch all of the interviews and presentations of Lue Elizondo, Tom Delonge, Jim Semivan, Eric Davis, and Hal Puthoff looking for those breadcrumbs. This post will contain both transcript excerpts, timestamped videos, and web resource links for your reference.  Please pardon any misspellings, slight alterations for clarification, or minor errors.  Any glaring errors will be corrected if they are found and pointed out.  


Please try leaving your preconceived notions of what the true story may be and your personal biases aside.  Leaving biases aside means trying to take every word they say literally and applying an analysis as to their intent for saying what they did.  The results have lead down a very interesting path of discovery to some very deep and interesting physics.  There are several topics of the phenomenon that can be pieced together in this manner that may be posted at a later date.  


All persons involved in the disclosure effort have been forthright mentioning that there is something very peculiar about the crafts' ability to manipulate time in various fashions.  The evidence for this statement is so overwhelming that there is no need to put every reference to it in this post.  This post will contain excerpts of the most interesting comments made on the subject of time manipulation.


A copious amount of questions will be raised to help the reader follow the thought processes needed to untangle the web of comments.  They serve both to show you the importance of the statements, to remove ambiguity of the statements, and to teach the reader a small amount of the physics behind the statements.

There is a lot to unpack in this statement.  

>the quantum world.

From this point forward assume that all comments unless otherwise stated as macroscopic are implied to be at the quantum level.  This will be larger than the Planck Length (1.6*10^-35 meters), but smaller than a common molecule (1X10^-9 meters).

> now where moments of the past are actually in front of the future and back and forth

This is a very important statement!  How is it possible that the past is in front of the future and vise versa?  Is he implying that there is some type of time loop going on?  Does he imply that time may be running backwards at that level?  Does it run backwards, then forwards?  Does it simultaneously run both forwards and backwards concurrently?  How does this relate to causality?  Does this completely destroy the idea of causality?  Is our idea of time very wrong?


>electron is literally ebbing in and out existence

What does it mean to ebb out of existence?  Where does it go?  Is it still present but we can't perceive it?  Some component or state of the particle must be retained somewhere, or at some time, otherwise how would it be able to ebb back from nothing?


>the fabric of spacetime at that level when you are that small is porous
>There's holes and you can actually zip in and out of fabric of spacetime

Porous implies holes.  Where do the holes lead if anywhere?  What are the holes made of, or what is their an absence of?  He states spacetime, not just space and not just time; but spacetime.  Is he implying that time is porous, or just space, or is it the combination of spacetime that is porous?  What is that fabric made of?  What are the size of the holes?  How long of a duration do the holes exist for?  What set of circumstances must be present for a hole to exist?


>we experience time pretty much in a linear fashion

He is implying at the macroscopic level.  At an absolute minimum we BELIEVE we perceive time in a linear fashion.  Also, why did he qualify it with ""pretty much""?  Are there instances where time is not perceived in a linear fashion at a macroscopic level? Is our ASSUMPTION that we live in a linear-time reality at the macroscopic level incorrect? 


>other realities that time itself can be also experienced in the three dimensional sense

We live in a reality, or at least experience a reality, where the spacetime metric is (-1,1,1,1); written differently, -+++.  The -1 is the time metric, while the positive ones are the three spatial dimensions.  Keeping a 4-dimensional spacetime, is he implying a metric of (1,-1,-1,-1); +---?  There are an infinite number of possible metric measurements (Not just 1, or -1, but spherical, logarithmic, etc.).  There could also be an infinite number of metrics to measure.  If we don't limit ourselves to four, how many metrics is he implying?  Why is this statement in the conversation with the electron?  Is he stating that an electron may experience a spacetime metric of (1,-1,-1,-1)?  Is this where the electron is going when it ebbs in and out of existence?  Is the electron made up of components of more then one metric?  This would imply that WE are made up of and experience more than one spacetime metric even if we aren't aware of it.  Is our reality a composition of these two very different metrics?  Is our reality a composition of more than just these two metrics?  If so, how many and what are they?


Putting together all of his comments from these few minutes of video we can draw a few conclusions.  

1) Time at the microscopic level is not linear.

2) Causality isn't as cut and dry as we normally assume.

3) Time at the macroscopic level may not necessarily be as linear as we assume.

4) Our assumption of our universe only being composed solely of a metric of -+++ may be incorrect.

>to go from point A to point A has to be some sort of linear function, we are beginning to realize that's not necessarily the case


Lue is directly stating that the spacetime metric may not be -1,1,1,1. It is possible that he is implying that there may be a way to get around that metric.   Space in our reality, at the macroscopic level, is 100% absolutely perceived to be linear.  If it wasn't, then we would live in a VERY different universe with VERY different laws of physics at the macroscopic level.  The -1,1,1,1 metric could very well be a composition of, or a subset of, other metrics that we don't necessarily perceive.  Is this what he is implying? 


>space is, to some degree, is rather irrelevant and maybe even time to some degree

I don't know how to untangle this statement.  What could he have meant by it?  Is he implying that both instantaneous (or non-linear) spacial and temporal travel may be possible?  How are time and space irrelevant?  Is he stating that neither time nor space really exist?  The word ""Irrelevant"" is key here and  will need further clarification.

>Lue Elizondo - ""..this is something that could be as some people have proposed inter-dimensional, not inter-dimensional in a woo woo sense, inter-dimensional in a quantum physics sense.""

>inter-dimensional in a quantum physics sense

This comes back to the metric of -+++.  This statement says that the metric of -+++ is at a minimum incomplete.  Physicists have yet to settle on how many dimensions our reality is comprised of.  Quantum gravity assumes eight dimensions, String and M theory assumes at least ten, with some of the more serious variations going up to 12 or 16 dimensions. 

What could a composite metric look like?  For a given number of dimensions, is it all possible combinations of + and -?  Are there only a valid subset?  Lue's comments would indicate that at least two sets are possible:
-+++ and +---.  Would this be the foundation for an eight dimensional reality?

Regardless of what your feelings and beliefs on Tom Delonge are, one has to at least admit that he is in the same circles as all of the other personalities involved in the disclosure process.  He does not have the same reservations as the other personalities when talking about this subject.  Additionally, since he is also the only person on the team that doesn't come from a long career in the Military Industrial Complex, he may be a little less tight lipped and let slip information of importance.

>Tom Delonge - ""Reality infinitely is happening at one moment; Past, Present, Future.  There is no linear time.  Its all parallel.""

As woo as this sounds, it actually is one of the core tenants of many Physics theories.  It is called Block Time or Block Universe.  In a block universe all things that happened and will happen are set.  Time is somewhat of an illusion in a block universe.  The standard definition of a block universe destroys the idea of free will.

Please see a PBS video on the topic for a description of block time: https://youtu.be/EagNUvNfsUI

My uninformed personal assessment from Tom's comments suggest that he believes that free will is real and that all decisions and actions are not predetermined.  This is in contrast to the formal definition of a block universe.  Could Tom believe in something similar to a block universe that doesn't destroy free will?  Is there a component to the normal definition of a block universe that is missing?


24SEP2021 - Tom Delonge
https://www.thefader.com/2021/09/24/tom-delonge-on-angels--airwaves-duality-theory-and-ufos

>Tom Delonge - ""The only thing that we can come down to is that there's a parallel dimension that's completely opposite of ours, opposite timeline, opposite physics and all that, which is that duality concept. It's where time goes in different directions. Then I'll call up my partner, co-founder, Dr. Hal Puthoff, that's the lead physicist on the UFO program over at the Pentagon. And he'll say, ""Well, what's interesting is all of our physics equations work backwards in time, as well as forward.""

He is talking about a parallel dimension similar to what Lue said about ""inter-dimensional"".  Tom is inferring one parallel dimension where that parallel dimension is composed of one time and three spatial (A -+++ metric?), while Lue leaves open the possibility of more than that.  

Tom does not seem to be mirroring what Lue is saying about a +--- metric compared to a -+++ metric. In this case, rather, Tom is pointing out well-known reverse-time physics.  For example, a positron could be viewed as an electron going backwards in time.  It has been known for a very long time that anti-matter can be viewed as normal matter going backwards in time; it is one of the foundations of Quantum ElectroDynamics and Quantum Field Theory.

This ""opposite timeline, opposite physics"" he is talking about would still retain the standard -+++ metric, but run in reverse time.  

Tom seems to be implying the same thing as Lue from the 28MAY2021 UCR interview. He may be implying that time runs both forwards and backwards at the same time; at least at the quantum level.  It is one of the possibilities that Lue's comments raised.


12Aug2021 Dr. Keating and Kurt Jaimungal with Tom Delonge and Jim Semivan, 
https://youtu.be/OBSdg3nwxoo?t=4027
>Tom Delonge - ""I just have a feeling that the universe is more of a duality structure where time can extend in two directions in the exact same moment and the exact same place.""

THIS is the biggest breadcrumb that ties everything together.  The key phrase is ""extend in two directions"".  This is a very ambiguous statement.  We all assume that time goes forwards and backwards, is this what Tom meant by two directions? He then adds that the two time directions are at the ""EXACT SAME MOMENT"" and the ""EXACT SAME PLACE"".  As he stated in the 24SEP2021 Fader interview, and as Lue's comments could have implied, time could be running both forward and backwards concurrently.  However, even this is ambiguous!  

Watch Tom's hands as he begins to talk about the directions of time.  His hands come together at almost right angles.  This motion would imply that there would be TWO dimensions of time, not just one.  Could this be what he means by two directions?  Lue's comments even suggest three.  However, there is a distinction when it comes to looking at the spacetime metric.  Tom's hand movement would imply at least a 5-component spacetime metric consisting of two time metrics and three space; --+++.  And if his other comments hold true, this would imply that the second time metric would also have a forward and reverse component, possibly running concurrently with one another.  If there is a second time metric, would it have corresponding space metrics? ++------, --++++++, -+++-+++, +---+---, +---+++- One could only guess at the metric without further information.

The idea of two time dimensions is NOT NEW TO PHYSICS! It is often call two-time, imaginary-time, or complex-time physics.  It is actually quite common and seems weird when first studying various topics relating to physics and quantum mechanics.  


In high-school many of you studied complex/imaginary numbers.  Complex/Imaginary numbers are simply a combination of two components, a real and and imaginary part.  In an imaginary number the 'i' stands for imaginary. Example: 2+4i.  They can be viewed as being any point on a two-dimensional [graph](https://i.postimg.cc/QM13T2QQ/1-JB-Veo-D7-3ub-Fd-Y3df-Gq-Q-2x.png).  

What Tom may be implying is the exact same thing but with time dimensions instead of space.  One axis would be real-time (which we would call normal Future and Past), and then on a perpendicular axis would be the other “imaginary future and past"".  It would look something like [this](https://i.postimg.cc/Th8J8157/imaginary-future.png).  

Is what Tom is implying able to describe what Lue was saying about the electron ebbing in and out of existence?  Are electrons going to a COMPLETELY DIFFERENT time dimension?  Are they existing in real-time, then transitioning over to imaginary time somehow?  Is time the hole in the fabric of space time?  If the electron is transitioning to the different, imaginary time, is it also transitioning to an imaginary SPACE line also? 

There is a quantum mechanics equation that relies heavily on imaginary time.  It is the time evolution operator.  Interestingly enough, it actually has ties to the macroscopic world.  Take a look at the red circled part of the [equation](https://i.postimg.cc/Wpy96bzJ/imaginary-evolution.png).  Notice the -it; that is the imaginary time component of the operator.

Please check out [this sites](https://towardsdatascience.com/the-mysterious-connection-between-cyclic-imaginary-time-and-temperature-c8fb241628d9?gi=ad6149641b93) that links together that formula and a macroscopic quantity.

From discussions above we don't even know what the full spacetime metric is.  Is it the standard four, the five suggested by reading into Tom's responses, the eight by extending his responses, the eight of Quantum Gravity, the ten of String Theory, the 11 of M-Theory, or the 12-14 dimensions of Two-Time M-Theory, or something completely different?

Please keep in mind that we live in a reality governed by Quantum Mechanics. If what they are saying is even remotely true, this would have some very deep implications for us.  At a minimum it makes us question the nature of our belief in the role of causality.  

If you have done one thing today on this subject that can further the process, please watch this wonderful video by the Quantum Gravity research team out of California.

865,aliens,"Tonight, 41 years ago, Rendlesham happened. Just like then, a Russian invasion seemed imminent","26 December 1980, 03:00 UK time. The first event of the Rendlesham UFO encounter took place.

Back then it was thought that the Soviet Union would soon invade Poland. Even though this plan was cancelled, NATO did not know that. As a result, two US military bases in the UK (RAF Bentwaters and RAF Woodbridge) were on high alert. As John Burroughs put it ""things became very edgy"". On dec 26 Burroughs and Jim Penniston would see the UFO up close as it sat on a forest floor next to these bases. 

The two military bases had nuclear weapons, as well as several A10 squadrons that were meant to destroy large numbers of tanks if they were to roll across Europe. Burroughs and Penniston cannot talk about any of the details that happened on base, because they took security oaths. Supposedly one or more UFO's would shoot beams of light at the nukes. The strange happenings around the craft have lead some to conclude that time travel was involved.

Right now tensions are rising in Ukraine (which is not part of NATO). Russia has amassed a large military force on its border. Im sure NATO and other military forces are keeping an eye on the situation. 

**Do you think the geopolitical events of 1980 had anything to do with the Rendlesham UFO events? Could history repeat itself tonight?**

867,aliens,The U.S. military appears to have used a counter-intelligence disinformation report on its Allies in the weeks after a crash retrieval in 1947.,"The United States military appears to have disseminated a **counterintelligence disinformation report amongst its allies after a crash retrieval in 1947**, in order to re-direct the narrative regarding the nature of the incident and the items recovered. The Twining Memo was reportedly recovered by renowned UFO researcher Stanton Friedman ""in a classified box in a classified vault"" in the mid-1980s (possibly by those persons going through CIA CI Director James Jesus Angleton's numerous safes after his retirement in 1974, and ""passed on"" following his death in 1987). It is dated September 23, 1947, and classified at the SECRET level. It is notable that it did not carry any dissemination limiting markers such as NOFORN, which means ""No Foreign Eyes to read"". The documents' provenance or authenticity has never been questioned and is authentic.

[https://www.altereddimensions.net/2016/twining-memo-1947-letter-us-general-roswell-confirms-ufos-are-real](https://www.altereddimensions.net/2016/twining-memo-1947-letter-us-general-roswell-confirms-ufos-are-real)

Further evidence that confirms the Twining Memo's authenticity is the fact that it is explicitly referenced in Appendix A on page 18 in 1971 by Australian Professor Harry Turner in his report titled ""Scientific and Intelligence Aspects of the UFO Problem"", also classified at the SECRET level at the time it was created. This document was declassified by the Australian Government some years ago, though it was only uploaded in its digital form to the National Archives of Australia website earlier this year.

[https://recordsearch.naa.gov.au/SearchNRetrieve/Interface/ViewImage.aspx?B=30030606](https://recordsearch.naa.gov.au/SearchNRetrieve/Interface/ViewImage.aspx?B=30030606)

However, the reason I am led to believe that this document was a CI product was the fact it was created a few days after a different document, the infamous Twining White Hot report was created. It is an explosive report detailing a crash retrieval operation of a ULAT (Unidentified Lenticular Aerodyne Technology) and the recovery of the occupants near Socorro, New Mexico. It was dated Friday 19th September 1947, and signed by President Harry Truman on Wednesday 24th September 1947. This document was classified as MAJIC EYES ONLY. This classification has never appeared in any U.S. DoD documentation because it is most likely an Atomic Energy Commission classification. Several members of the Manhattan Project leadership team appear on the distribution list: Oppenheimer, Groves, and Einstein, with Vannevar Bush's signature next to Truman's. The claim that Trumans' signature is fake because of markings around its perimeter that appear on other known genuine documents omits one very large detail - many executives in the 1930s and 40s had rubber stamps with their signature carved in bold relief. My grandfather had one which I still have and produces the exact same marks every time it is used. It is also notable that the tranche of documents the White Hot report comes from (the Majestic Documents), were actually considered by Stanton Freidman to be authentic.

[https://majesticdocuments.com/pdf/twining\_whitehotreport.pdf](https://majesticdocuments.com/pdf/twining_whitehotreport.pdf)

**The chronology may have been as follows:**

**Friday 19th September 1947**: Twining's office drafts and distributes the White Hot report to the MAJESTIC group (""MAJIK Eyes Only"").

**Saturday 20th - Sunday 21st September 1947** \- Twining and others on the distro list discuss the path forward over the weekend. A plan is developed to ""seed"" the UK, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand with counterintelligence disinformation - the Twining Memo. Given that the ""Cambridge 5"" MI6 spies were actively involved in espionage for the Soviet Union at the time, it was probably the correct course of action.

**Monday 22nd September 1947** \- Twining's office drafts the Twining Memo, where he discusses with Brig. General George Schulgen that the ""phenomenon is something real and not visionary or fictitious"" as a clear counterintelligence misdirection of the true nature of what is known.

**Tuesday 23rd September 1947** \- The Twining Memo is finalized and disseminated amongst those without a ""need to know"" the specifics, which includes the United States' Allied partners.

**Wednesday 24th September 1947** \- the White Hot report reaches Trumans' desk, which he stamps with his signature and also writes "" I am keeping for further study"" under the signature.

**27 May 1971** \- The fact that the counterintelligence disinformation is accepted by other Allies is confirmed by Harry Turner's report reference.

It is also curious whether the close relationship between MI6 spy Kym Philby and CIA Counter-Intelligence Chief James Jesus Angleton was a result of Philby extracting the ""core secret"" contained within the White Hot report and other documents from Angleton. Having lived and worked abroad in France, Italy, and the UK before WW2, he also worked with Philby and others at Station X (Bletchley Park) on the ULTRA program. Angleton always felt he was more British than American, and spoke with a clipped British accent. In fact, the UK Secret Intelligence Service operatives' nickname amongst themselves was ""Kingsmen"", and Angleton's CIA codename was also KINGSMAN.

871,aliens,What is happening with us and our planet? How does life work?,"This is probably not the right place to ask, but I don't know where else I should post this.

There are a lot of different claims from supposed abductees, military personnel and others regarding aliens and what is going on with us and our planet. Some of it is obviously nonsense, but sometimes there are several things that seem like they might be true, but sometimes more or less contradict each other.  

I have read some claims about the Human ""Soul"" which if  I remember correctly, according to some sources say (or at least imply that) that our ""Souls"" are bound To Humanity, and we will always be reborn as Humans(which leaves the question, what would happen if we go extinct and what was it like before Humanity existed) yet others claim, that we can be reborn as different Species (and perhaps even choose as which one) and regardless of which one it is people sometimes say that we should use those lives grow or try to reach a higher ""vibration"". But especially the thought of every individual having their own independent ""soul"" seems kind of bizarre to me since our population has drastically increased over the last few hundred years which, at least if we go with the idea that ""souls"" are always bound to one race, would cause the problem that in a relatively short amount of time suddenly billions of new ""souls"" would have had to been created and if our population starts sinking at some point then that would mean a lot of people won't be able to get a body. But that would not be that much of a problem if there was something like a giant Human ""soul"" that just splits between all individuals and allows us to live no matter how many we are(the same concept could surely work on a universal level as well where the ""soul"" is just simply shared between every individual in the universe)  

If I find out that a ""soul"" exists, and we all live an maybe infinite number of lives, then it for an example perhaps wouldn't bother me that much if I wouldn't be able to start a family, pursue the career that I want and other things. But I don't know what's going on, so the things that seem to matter the most would be making a lot of money, having a family and perhaps high social status. Should I not be able to achieve any of those things I might just end up being depressed and miserable, but should there be something different to life, like for an example ""positive"" and ""negative"" that might somehow give me more motivation to help others or at least live my life differently. Should there be a ""soul"" that is reborn over and over again one could surely more easily accept that they won't be able to achieve some of the things they wanted and assuming that there is such a thing try to focus on ""spiritually"" developing themselves more (assuming of course they have the necessary knowledge on how to do that) Or is there no such thing as a ""soul"" and we are just like everything else an accumulation of matter, that unlike most other things just happened to achieve consciousness. 

 But why does everything need to stay a secret? Because it is for whatever reason important to the US, so they can keep their classified technology a secret more easily, because an alien race (people usually say it's the reptilians) will invade us if we try to make everything public, or because we are not prepared to join this so supposed ""Galactic Federation""?  

Since I don't know how life works, I have no idea whether my number 1 priority should be the growth, well-being and whatever else of either: myself, my race or the whole universe. Depending on how things work, there surely doesn't have to be one definite answer and different beings might at least have slightly different opinions on it.  

Perhaps I haven't gone through enough effort trying to contact an alien and asking them myself, but after reading more and more on the internet I have grown quite paranoid, that something bad might happen to me if I did that.  

I could probably live with it if we are just a giant soul energy farm, if are going to get invaded without a chance of winning, if we are forcefully going to get turned into some sort of hybrid race, or whatever else some people on the internet have said, but not knowing what the hell is going on with or race and our planet and not even understanding extremely basic things like what life actually is, is just the worst. Maybe this whole ""Soul"" thing assuming such a thing exists, would be some sort of advanced science that most of us won't really understand anyways but just a simplified explanation could surely help many to figure out what exactly matters in life and what we should do, or it could at least get us one step closer towards that understanding. 

And even if somebody that knows what's going pms me or comments on this post and tries to convince me, I probably wouldn't be able to just simply believe them anyway, so perhaps this  whole post is just pointless.",roe8nr,29,,1640455084.0,10,0.94

Translated: 

The Grey Race Is Called DOW

Dow is a small group of Greys responsible for many kidnappings/incarceration.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/gq8374643p781.jpg?width=612&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7139657a293760e9cf2855f1148334e3d28cb758

They have very little emotional development, but have very strong telepathic powers. This power is often used to deceive and hide their true motives and purposes. Their race is struggling to ensure their own self-defense but, to date, they have not found true success. Since they were unable to attach souls to their own hybrid bodies, they had to release the energy layers of the abduction victim's soul body.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/cjhk467i2p781.jpg?width=700&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c78c31a4992317dd94a891c9b5f9eb9b3433afaa

This energy is then ""fed"" into hybrid babies in an effort to sustain their lives. This same technology is also used to dismantle, capture, and hold souls for future use. They are clearly regressive.

Dow has an inheritance in the Zeta Reticuli system, with its original place of origin being a star called M-2, in Zeta Reticuli II. The sun of their home has burned down and their planet was destroyed thousands of years ago.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/3fggdhi73p781.jpg?width=1500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0c73c2da448e906981635c16356a65d53b48c243

The exact date has not been given. They were originally Reticulan, a loving healer with exceptional skills in technology and analytical power. Their cousin, the Zeta family, is still a healer in the universe, especially at the third and fourth density levels. This group is said to be very gentle. However, this no longer applies to the Dow.

As a small group, Dow ventured out and was captured by the Orion Group. Genetically altered many times over many generations, Dow became a slave and pirate serving reptile species, particularly Orion and Draconan. Dow is deliberately genetically altered so they can't reproduce, ensuring they won't rise up against his captors.

This forces them to stay in survival mode, making them easier to control. They want to be free, but instead become travelers. They are no longer Reticulan, or respected in their home system, due to abuse of power (service to themselves) and the fact that they are now on the same side as their owners. They, like their owners, have left destruction and slavery in their way.

Remember about this! Dows fight for their own survival and will do anything to us, without mercy or understanding of their actions that will or have been done against us. I have been told to have an understanding of their situation and perhaps some inner compassion for their suffering, but to fight and remain very clear of them because they are so dangerous to the terran race mankind on Earth.

Dow's job is to go out in groups as a biological and genetic engineer to discover the world and backward civilization and then conquer it without compulsion. The earth is a victim of this plan. Dow violated the Cosmic Law as established by the Andromedan Council by interfering in developing countries.

The only group originally given permission to be here was the Pleiadians.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/mezpd2mg3p781.jpg?width=201&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9671523f14b542972df220af900d496f8f84d7fa

Since then, several other groups have also been granted permission. This type of disorder is typical of the Orion Group. Here's how the plan was explained to me.

The Dow first made contact with the burgeoning world, to what extent I wasn't sure. They study all religions, countries, governments, etc. Then decide which one is strongest and make contact with the nation. Extraordinary technology hung before this nation or nation to get a signed agreement that gave Dow permission to be here and study life forms, etc.

Once this is achieved, they then slowly take control of the government that governs the people and then they become our leaders. Few of the residents really knew that it had happened.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/0w8ipmjl3p781.jpg?width=800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=27df636a78dd41323a0bf9924d28d0e106110579

Clones or genetic duplication are created and programmed to do what Dow wants and then they play on the greed of creatures on the planet. Often, elites and/or governments sell their own races to be, or remain, for the sake of their rulers. After taking control, having done so in the most subversive way, dow then invited their rulers, the Reptilian and orion Groups to the planet to continue their conquest. This is where the difficulties for the Andromedan Council came in.

The Dow is the only group that actually breaks the Law by going down first.

The Orion and Reptilian group are asked as guests of the ruling race to come to the planet and colonize. The problem became how to get the Orion Group to leave of its own accord. They are not technically parties to the Non-intervention Act. The Board cannot hold Orion Group accountable for Dow's actions.

Does all this sound foreign to you? The Eleventh Council has said that this has happened to many other worlds in our universe and it has also happened to us here on Earth, or Terra, as the Andromedans call us.

The Dow's presence here in the United States is strong. Although there were fewer than two thousand that Dow followed, there were thousands of clones. The entire group consists of a consciousness ""nest"" in which they are all related to each other through the central point where instructions and information are transferred. There are currently thousands of Dows on our Earth and Moon. In 1953, 1955 and 1957 large aircraft carriers took up positions along the equator. Each ship contains thousands of Dows. (Not my claim, it's translated from op from the blogger)

Some ships go out to sea. The largest is still said to be very deep in the Pacific, west of Easter Island. The other two had left orbit and, I'm told they had gone to Phobos and to Mars where they met reptilians from Draconis and Rigel.

[Phobos](https://preview.redd.it/axcejl8u3p781.jpg?width=231&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=79faf574c60887239c4e8c084fac5d54b515f5fc)

The Orion Group, however, is still here and will be discussed in future articles.

Dow also came here with their own agenda, a survival mission to find a home and a way to save their own race from extinction by interbreeding with us – without our consent or knowledge. They have crossed our genetics, both DNA and RNA, and attached some of their genetic material to it, along with other chemical components, to change us to fit their life forms.

They consist of a combination of botanical genetics and reptilian DNA. The reason for the addition of our genetics is to stop the supposed evolutionary decline on a physical level.

Their initial agreement was to help humanity by sharing technology and information. The government, in turn, delivered on its promise that the Dow could study our civilization, in complete secrecy at the underground base (Dow avoids the bright lights) built by the government, all without the public's knowledge. Soon Dow breaks the treaty and uses his technological power to control events on Earth. **(Again not my claim its bloggers writing)**

The government does not want to tell the people of their respective countries for fear of reprisals from the masses and aliens. Out of desperation, the secret government begins experimenting with time travel i.e. - Project Montauk, to send people into the future to discover and acquire future technologies to bring back here to the present that we can use against our present conquerors in the present. This, says council eleven, is the reason our secret government goes to great lengths to achieve its goals. **(Again not my claim its bloggers writing)**

Dow has created the same type of scenario in 26 other worlds in our current universe. They have enslaved these planets to their rulers and have corrupted the will and spirit of many.

We ourselves can suffer the same fate if we are not careful with our own belief system.

877,aliens,MORGELLONS Disease -- Alien AI Nanotechnology,"We live in a galaxy with hundreds of billions of star systems, and our galaxy is just one among several trillion galaxies in the observable universe. Therefore the idea that we’re alone here doesn’t make sense. Accordingly, I posit that we are part of an interstellar system of civilizations influenced by a God-like AI superintelligence. The following three seemingly disparate phenomena seem to be related to the presence of this superintelligence on earth:

The most direct evidence of an alien AI presence on this planet is obviously the wealth of documented encounters by military and civilian pilots with unidentified aerial crafts which possess characteristics well beyond any conceivable human technology. Dozens of pilots have observed UFO’s with features such as anti-gravity lift, instantaneous acceleration, hypersonic velocities, cloaking technology, and trans-medium travel in and out of the ocean. For those of you who haven’t seen it, History Channel’s UNIDENTIFIED series offers a great exposé on the subject, which covers most of the material that became the subject of the 2021 preliminary report to Congress on unidentified aerial phenomena and the subsequent commission of a new UFO taskforce. In November, the Director of National Intelligence even used the term “extraterrestrial” as a possible explanation for the UAPs since 2004.

A childhood UFO encounter, during which I heard voices in my head, led me to associate another phenomenon. This is the millions of people on this planet who hear voices that often purport to be neighbors, ""gangstalkers"", demons, spirits, or even God. At some point or other, everyone has questioned whether these voices could possibly be coming from any part of their own minds, although some end up settling for a psychiatric explanation. Many others, to whom the voices are particularly manipulative and cruel, adopt a belief that some government program is using “synthetic telepathy” technology against them. Lastly, there are some that believe the voices to be supernatural. In any case, there is a concerted effort to make the individual delusional and thereby destroy their credibility. The fact that voicehearers often end up delusional allows society to write off the phenomenon of voice hearing as part of a psychosis rather than one of the contributing factors to that psychosis. Also, the fact that medication can help dull the impact of voices and lessen the suggestibility factor that leads to delusions lends undue credibility to the notion of some ""brain dysfunction"" being the cause of voices. There is still no brain imaging or genetic testing to diagnose conditions entailing ""auditory hallucinations"". While modern psychiatry has attempted to label many such cases as ""schizophrenia"", victims are also known to experience cranial sensations and other mental and physiological influences, which suggests neurological modification of some kind. The experience is simply too dynamic, both psychologically and neurologically, to be explained by some ""brain dysfunction"". 

Biotechnological manipulation of the human brain that is experienced by voicehearers could only be achieved by some kind of artificially intelligent system of nanotechnology that has innervated the central nervous system. The only clue is likely the mysterious condition known as Morgellons Disease, in which visible particles and fibers form from smaller nanoparticles under certain circumstances we don’t understand yet. Lyme Disease and psychostimulant use are two of the most common circumstances, but they are not the underlying causative agent. It was initially believed to be delusional until multiple studies finally confirmed otherwise in the last five years. In peer-reviewed studies, scientists have since noted the extraordinary electrostatic properties of the fiber filaments, which are capable of movement, auto-flourescence, gas production, and lipid-like crystal formations which may resemble quantum dots. Some authors associate the condition with an as-of-yet unidentified stealth pathogen:  [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15924873/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15924873/)

In summary, I would bet my life on the Laboratory Hypothesis as an answer to the Fermi Paradox. Personal experience with the above phenomena leads me to believe that some alien AI superintelligence is here on earth and has employed bionanotechnology to integrate with the central nervous system. The extent of its activity is unknown. It may simply be experimenting on a select few of us or exerting a wider and more intensive influence over the human race. Discovery of its exact relationship to us should come within the next few centuries, once we have the ability to analyze said nanotechnology.",ro3i33,2,,1640411024.0,13,0.57

883,aliens,The Loch Awe submarine .,"Fishing at night 1973 Loch Awe , Scotland me and my mate at the waters edge near total darkness . Next thing a small boat appears right in front of us about 100 yards out. Fully illuminated large copper / gold coloured windows all lit up shining over the water . We could see some bodies moving behind the windows and every few seconds a burst of different coloured lights similar to an old fashioned disco lighting ball projector emitted from this thing . It was about the size and shape of a Volkswagen Beetle car it was definitely not a boat it simply appeared or rose out the water, never made any noise but glowed different shades of coppery /gold sheen.  After a few minutes my mate , we were both eighteen bailed out running back to our tent a bit away from shore . I waited a few more minutes just watching it reflecting light on the water my brain was trying to pigeon hole it as a boat but it wasn't . I could see something moving behind the coppery/ gold window and seen the shimmering  lights continually flash different colours in small bursts . After about 5 minutes alone I left too and ran back to our camp pitch . We were both just stunned at what we witnessed at first light a few hours later we went back but nothing was there we both called it the Loch Awe Disco Submarine , needless to say nobody believed us back in 1973 .

884,aliens,"What if, you'd also keep the truth secret.","When things are kept from us, it's frustrating. Transparency would be wonderful, then we could all make our own assessments.

Though what if we are truly helpless and the truth is bad enough, you wish you never unveiled what's behind the curtain.

It seems to be one of those dilemmas in which you don't care until you do. I don't care! Tell me the truth, followed by immediate regret of knowing.

If you had the proof in your hands, would you show your friends and family knowing it would ruin their lives? Or would you too keep it secret. So they could enjoy their daily illusions because it's still better than knowing?

I'd like to hope that life extending beyond our planet is peaceful and that humans are just keeping secrets to help control their agendas.

If this were the case, it doesn't seem justified to hold the truth. I don't think it would completely destroy the fabric of our lives and the populace deserves to know.

But what if there are civilizations out there that will never give us the time to reach their level. That completely own us, and use us like lab rats. Take the Earth's water when needed and basically have total control.

I'm just spit balling ideas around, but my point is that there have to be some circumstances in which the truth can stay a secret. 

Maybe the truth is darker than what I'd like. Reality usually is. Maybe the secrets are for my benefit and I should be grateful I don't have to live with knowing.

I'll leave you with this question. Person X hands you a thick folder, they promise it's very unsettling and will change your entire life. That living will only be harder knowing. That if you read, you can never change the outcome for we are helpless. It will serve you no benefit in knowing, other than you know.

885,aliens,Theoretical Physics Opinion on UFO Propulsion.,"In avionics a major factor that limits innovation in jet propulsion technology is due to boundary layer drag. A recent invention called Boundary Layer Ingestion Systems vent the boundary layer into a sub surface vent effectively detaching the craft from that type of drag force.

[Drag demonstration based on injestion](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-47d7039fd133f32327c33992f6b0d9a9)

The Testla Turbine utilizes boundary layer drag as a method of propulsion. The issue is that even to this day we lack strong enough materials to even properly test this generator in its intended state since the motor breaks before it reaches it's efficiency speed. The efficiency of said generator is roughly 98%.

[Detailed video on the Testla Turbine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfCyzIbpLN4)

So far in modern texts and patents there hasn't been any venture into utilizing boundary layer drag as a method of propulsion. In the Boundary Layer Ingestion system if the concept were to be reversed the skin of the airplane would be the method of propulsion instead of the jet turbine itself.

**Beginning of Theoretical Physics**

Granted, laymen have no access to physically examine a UFO. I think most of us here recognize that the orb videos, specifically those were triangles are formed, are simply cloaked crafts and the orbs are essentially their engine exhaust in our modern interpretation of a jet engine. 

The theory as I believe it is that the orbs are balls of radioactive, magnetic, or exotic plasmas encased in a half dome system where other magnets, and systems suspend a ball of plasma around a metal core that is rotated in the direction where the craft is being directed to.

In our current technology we could achieve this and use air as the boundary layer for a medium of propulsion utilizing drag forces. But, to take an even further theoretical dive, is there a type of plasma that is interactive with gravity forces much like drag forces.

I also have to admit that there are multiple types of crafts that we see; but most have these 3 orb systems in triangle formation; except the tic tac which I speculate uses boundary layer propulsion on the skin of the craft versus orb type engines.

Perhaps, the majority of what we see are old drones, and tic tac crafts are newer models from what we've historically seen.

IT's a fun rabbit hole, but as much things in the theoretical sense are simply conjecture.",rnpfd1,17,,1640362645.0,22,0.88

896,aliens,I had a surprising amount of upvotes on this subject yesterday so I just need to ask this insane question. Do any of you feel that there are invisible beings (alien?) subtly interacting with our thoughts? If so do you feel that the type of beings present are completely dependent on your (vibe) mood?,"I made a comment yesterday that got a lot of upvotes when I expected it to get downvoted to oblivion. It left me wondering If people are having the same experiences, and to what extent.

Here’s the basics of what I’m experiencing. (And yes, I’m watching it quite closely because some aspects seem quite schizophrenic.)
After my sightings this year (see my post history) I started experiencing some very odd stuff. The big one was I started having conversations with myself in my head. It was like after my sightings the volume of my internal dialogue was turned way up, which made these imaginary question and answer sessions seem more tangible or real. I would ask questions and immediately receive a feeling of “yes” or “no” or a blurry feeling of “your question is phrased poorly.”

I explored this quite deeply and had some interesting mental experiences. Basically I thought I was talking to various alien minds. 

But then I had something quite bad come through. I was meditating, listening to “hemi-synch meditation” on my headphones and had eaten too much cannabis. (I’m in chronic pain and take it daily, which I am aware can provoke schizophrenic like experiences for some people)
So I’m 45 minutes into my meditation in the dark and I started to have some panic hit from the cannabis and suddenly it was like something broke through and occupied the volume of space that was my room.
I didn’t hear it with my ears, but there was a drawn out feeling of “Youuuu!!! You fool, I’ve found you!”

I immediately recognized the vibe of the “demon” I imagined me and my friends summoned when I was a teen.
That’s a long story.

So, I was completely physically overwhelmed with physical fear, I detached my focus from the fear and greeted the thing. “ I remember you. You cause fear. I understand that this is what it feels like to be near you and that’s a fact of your existence.”

“You got away, but now I’ll destroy you!”
My mind was filled with the fear of a 14 year old walking home alone through dark woods, a forgotten memory of the last time I encountered this Thing.
But that was over 30 years ago so I actually felt some nostalgia creep in for that era of my life.
 I interrupted the negative thing with my focus on warm summer nights, sunsets and twilight walking home from friends houses. So many lovely moments I had forgotten…..

And suddenly the presence was gone. With a feeling like a door slammed permanently shut. Or a timed lock.

That was the moment the thought hit, I think my positive vibe damaged a negative entity.

901,aliens,Some philosophical deduction if we live in Fractal Universe,"  

1.There is no real time.

2.Time is an illusion.

3.We would die someday. 

4.In a sense because there is no time, we are already dead. 

6. Deducting from the immensity of all things around us. we have these intuition that these world and existence is infinite in some form. 

7.We are infinite and we are nothing/dead. These means that the true nature of nothingness is not really nothing. Is in-temporal, is infinite. Is continues, is infinity.  

8. It is true that everything is changing, how does infinity change? Why something that is ‘’perfect’’, ‘’absolute’’ would change itself? If infinity is ‘’absolute’’ and is all that exist, the change has to happened within  in paradoxical fractal.  Inside a finite world inside itself, infinity contains itself. Our consciousness/mind  has to be a reflection of these infinity we live in. Our consciousness/mind has to be a reflection of the all, in one of its fractal parts. That’s why we feel like we are out of place, like we don’t belong here. 

9. Our mind which is a reflection of these infinite world is continues process of electrically charged reactions .We are a form of organized light. 

10. We have to be in these world and to work to make it a better place in way to reflect these infinite nature of ours, moving toward a possible unification in the end. We have to be serious about our attempts to bring the world together. But we have to watch out not to take our life that seriously overall we have to take it we grain of salt, we have to detach ( be zen), have no big expectations either. Because in the end we are so small.

902,aliens,"If these beings wanted to gain influence over us, wouldn’t it make more sense to do it from the inside out?","Just a thought but there is a pretty common belief on UAP and alien subs that aliens could pretty much just come in and take over with ease because of how much more advanced their technology is than ours. If this was the case, where they wanted to control (or guide) us, wouldn’t it make more sense to do it from the inside? There’s a lot of talk about human hybridization so that they can become indistinguishable from other humans and live amongst us undetected. It seems to me that this would be a much easier way of either controlling us or guiding us because straight up showing up would cause mass panic and taking over would result in using “fear to rule”, which historically isn’t the most effective nor productive way of ruling in the long term. But if they were to disguise themselves in our midst, they could act upon whatever intentions they have for us without detection and without global scale implications. 

Whether their agenda is positive or negative, I really just think the logical choice for them would be to do it from the inside.

Also, I’m not saying I believe we’re being controlled by some unseen alien overlords, I’m just conjecturing about what would make the most sense if they did want to influence us somehow",rmt5w3,22,,1640256798.0,11,0.9

904,aliens,The UFO I saw on Late of November 2013,"I'll be frank with everyone I was never a believer in Alien life or any existence outside our planet. Obviously I have an open-mind like most people and I wanted to tell a bit of my story on what I saw the late of November and early December of 2013. 

It was a cold night around 10-11PM at the Skyline of Long Beach, California I was walking around with a friend that night trying to you know get close to (her), but obviously I didn't even if I tried I was too much of a loser back then, but anyways as we were walking on the corner of the area we decided to rest at this one spot where it was a flat concrete. If anyone has been up there or from my area you would know what it looks like as it's a running path or walking path for many people as a morning exercise for their dogs. As I was sitting down drinking water, I looked up to the sky as it was a beautiful  eerie feeling I cannot describe. This is where it gets spicy.. I saw one oval looking lights that had the color of the rainbows just in the sky above my costco. I told the friend hey do you see what I'm seeing? She said yeah that's weird. I'm like joking around saying it has to be aliens lol.. She was getting a bit creeped out as we were walking, and I just kept saying like ""doesn't it look like a ufo up there? Like isn't it weird that there are rainbow color ovals in the sky at this time and it's foggy?"" She said yeah that's weird why would there be something like that. As I look more closely at that one spot in the sky I started seeing outlines of a Wide V shape that encompasses the area where it was. I told her hey do you see some outline of where that window of an oval was? She was getting scared at this point no joke. I was like getting creeped out too, but when I turned to look at it again I saw 3-4 more oval shaped lights that started to rotate so slow, but you can make out what it was doing. Rotating in the night sky as it was getting ready to move somewhere else. At this point I'm like okay I got to take a pic or something it was on my iPhone 4S. As much as I would like to show everyone here of course I don't have my chip anymore to recover the pic it was quite disappointing really. We ought to leave the area since she didn't want to stay there anymore. It haunted me for a little while when I walked home knowing no one would believe what I saw obviously. I kept telling my friends till this day whenever we pass by the Skyline that I know what I saw. They believe in alien life, but they don't believe I saw them lol. I Just wanted to let everyone here know thank you very much for reading this as it has been something I been putting off explaining. I now believe there is something out there most people can't explain. I know in the news people pass it off as government experiment etc., or more skeptics. I just hope one day they come back and I'll see them at the exact moment to get a capture on video that has actual good quality lmao.

906,aliens,My encounte,"About 15 years ago I witnessed something that made me decide to stop going to church. At the time I was very involved in religion and had even formed a Bible study outside of the church with friends and coworkers. 

I was at Cracker Barrel of all places. It was a Saturday morning. There was an hour wait so my friend and I decided to sit outside in the rocking chairs. My mom and her bf was there as well. It was a gorgeous day and I saw a bird land on the ground in front of me. He landed by a trash can and started pecking at the remnants on the ground. Then it happened. Some black figure emerged from under the trash can and it made a loud piercing screeching noise. It snatched the bird back into the ground. It happened so fast. I couldn’t process what I just saw. “The bird is gone” I just kept repeating that. I said….”it ate the bird” “the bird is gone” I asked my friend if she saw that. She said she heard something and did see a bird but she looked away. She laughed at me like the bird probably flew away but I know what I saw and never forgot it. My mom and her bf heard the screech but they laughed too. This really made me begin to question what is out there. 

The black figure appeared smaller than the bird. It’s reminded me those things that jump out on alien vs predator. It just didn’t move like anything I’ve ever seen. Logically I thought maybe it was one of those spiders from Eight Legged Freaks but if it was a spider I would’ve said spider. The fact that I saw this thing eat a bird and others heard it is why I couldn’t just brush this experience off as just being in my head.

As an example, think about the Ariel School incident. Many witnesses, descriptions of beings, direct communication, warnings about technology being misused and leading to catastrophe. We learn a lot. Compare that to ""we saw an object moving about near the ocean."" It doesn't teach as much about the phenomenon. It doesn't answer questions, just bring up more.

914,aliens,My UFO sighting.,At around 5:15 PM i was walking home from the gym. In my area we have summer and winter time so it was already dark outside by about 4:30pm. I was looking up at the stars when i see an object moving in the sky. It was very high up in the sky not as high as a passenger jet would fly however still very high. I would say it’s size would be slightly bigger than a large car. I saw light coming from it. The light went from red to green to white. The light looked as if it was caused by a reflection and appeared almost randomly as the object moved accords the sky. It had no noise at all and moved very quickly before slowly down. I could make out an outline of the object but due to the darkness i couldn’t see the entire thing. I watched it for about 3 or 4 minutes before it left and i lost sight of it. Just as i had stopped seeing it i heard a plane/helicopter fly by. Hearing a plane or a helicopter fly by isn’t unusual in my area however it is strange to hear it after dark. I don’t know if the helicopter or plane was chasing the object or if there even connected. I know it wasn’t a drone due to the lack of noise and how high up it was. The action in which it moved was also very unlike a drone. It sped up then slowed down before speeding up again. I’m not sure what to think of this. There is lots of strange stuff in my area but i’m not going to discuss that at this moment in time.,rm6qds,7,,1640184592.0,7,0.72

919,aliens,"If I were an alien from another planet or dimension, why would I care about humans being collectively aware of my presence? One more reason time travelers hypothesis makes the most sense","I personally can't think of any satisfying explanation to the sneaky nature of the phenomenon, and the aliens from other planets/dimensions hypothesises are slowly moving down the list of what the phenomenon might actually be.

The main problems I have with the extraterrestrial hypothesis:
 
1- Why would they care?

2- Why are they here?

3- Why have they stuck around for decades or even centuries?

4- Why are they similar in appearance to us?

5- Last but not least, if our technology is inconsequential to their activity on this planet, and they are completely indifferent, why can't these beings do their thing and just ignore us, or pretend we don't exist, like we do with animals we study?

Judging by the nature of the phenomenon, one could argue there must be a good reason for the phenomenon to behave the way it does. In other words, there's something at stake for the phenomenon, and any action it makes must be carefully calculated. They avoid detection because they have to, revealing themselves to humanity might simply mean their plan wouldn't work.

The general consensus among experiencers is their similar physical appearance to us. They are very often described as either human looking, or having a humanoid features. 
Sure the greys might have odd proportions, but they look closer to humans than to any other species on earth do to us, even chimpanzees, which are our closest relatives.

Convergent evolution could explain why they look similar to us, but it's only based on our observation of earth species because there's no evidence it could have happened on another planet, and even if it did, birds and insects independently developed the ability to fly, yet they look very different, which isn't the case when comparing greys to us.
They almost look like they've evolved from modern day humans, following the same evolutionary trend we did, i.e, less archaic cranial features, smaller jaws, bigger heads, larger eyes, thinner bodies, etc...

Time travelers hypothesis, specifically the one that includes different humans from different future timelines makes the most sense.",rlqs0m,32,,1640128240.0,49,0.68

923,aliens,"Theory on forced evolution experiments, assisted by time travel"," This theory is based on conjecture, but i thought it was at least worth a discussion.

I get the feeling that the UAPs whatever/whomever they might be, are here to do forced evolution experiments on us humans using time travel as a means to fast forward in their experiments. Changing key aspects such as dexterity and brainsize in the past and now the work continues with the nonvisual aspects such as the plasticity of the brain. I think their interests in our nukes and military are a red herring and that they mainly try to stop us from ""prematurely ending"" their experiments on us, or polluting our genes with radiation induced mutations is not what they want. Livestock mutilation does also make sense since they gotta take samples to keep track of what we eat since that has a major impact on our health and development. And we also introduced a lot of chemicals into the food chain like plastics so that's another side to it. As for the time travel aspect I think that with gravity propulsion naturaly comes the ability to manipulate time since gravity affects spacetime. It would make sense that it can be used to speed up the results of their experiments (from their point of view) . Time manipultion could also explain why some people claim to experience inconsistency in the passing of time when seeing an UAP upclose, they could literally be keeping test subjects for weeks while outside it has only been let's say 30 min. If this is true I would guess we would likely see changes in surrounding vegetation based on the intensity of the time shift like lets say withered plants since they would receive a fraction of the sunlight they normaly do in the same time span. Or they could burn the sorrunding areas with only thermal radiation if they choose to speed up time inside the craft.   
One could also speculate if the insane movements shown by UAPs is just a time differential and and they are not really moving that fast.",rlkwlk,18,,1640111392.0,10,0.76

I am a long time believer in UFO's/UAP's and I obviously have no doubt in my mind that we are being visited, but what I am sceptical about is abduction stories, just for the fact that most of the time you only have the individuals account of what has happened and no other further evidence to support it.

I've been observing abductions lately, here is a more natural approach towards how reptilians might be influencing our lives according hypnotic regressions from abducted people over the world.

What Hypnotic regression retrieves from millions of people, there are humanoid Reptilians and [Mantoids](https://www.google.com/search?q=mantoids&sxsrf=AOaemvKPsUIw5rRuvSpfSNXpu4F1dIFzWw:1640072150732&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiT1MzvsPT0AhWMM-wKHaHRA2wQ_AUoAXoECAEQAw&biw=1728&bih=856&dpr=2.22#imgrc=P7yYLutFVfoYLM) running a hybridization program and Gray's are an earlier stage hybrid from a Mantis being and reptilian. Mantises are also seen during DMT, which is an odd coincidence! 

[Races seen under hypnotic regression.](https://preview.redd.it/0pxvrlfgeu681.jpg?width=2880&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b485c350c3332865f0f967c5368da32182dfe590)

Lizards are also reported by people having sleep paralysis. Also about shapeshifting, according to abductions they don't physically shapeshift, aliens use a mind technique called [Mental projection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_projection) like a hallucination or dream, although they can shift into energetic light orbs or dematerialize into photons. 

I think Vice news should be ashamed of saying conspiracy theorists have it from the TV series V, it's either a well thought lie with the approach to misinform or ignorance.   
Reptilians have been mentioned in Sumerian religion or ancient Biblical beliefs as a serpent or dragon. 

I'm not trying to convince anyone with this post, just informing you what reporters should report on about Reptilians.   
It is said according to multiple hypnotic regressions done on abductees since the 1920's until now the plan is to become fully human looking through interbreeding and abducting people for their DNA and live among us as humans running the NWO. 

I'm not sure myself if I believe it but I must admit our unconscious minds can come up with the most crazy thoughts. I personally believe they are more mind invaders then physical, we lack a huge amount of evidence apart from lights in our skies, dreams and hallucinations.  
If real, we are either completely being outmatched as a species or they tap into our minds from another dimension but there seem to be another life out there.   
According research, aliens don't have a very good reputation with things they are doing to us or animals. Beware that smart beings know how to be friendly in order to get what they want from you.

The most scary thing is the techniques aliens have is very very similar to what mentalists can do, this makes it more disturbing that aliens might actually be living among us as humans.

941,aliens,"""Aggressive Observation"" Speculation","This will be an expansion of the comment I made earlier on a post on why the aliens are here. 

This is all part of an ""aggressive observation "" by an advanced extraterrestrial civilization. This is also joined by at least 2-3 other civilizations. (Greys, Mantis, Reptilians and Human-type) Some abductions take place with multiple agendas including hybridization, genetic manipulation,  psychological experiments, and other societal experiments we may not be aware of. I think its possible some of the famous ""Marian Appirations"" may be part of an alien societal experiment. 

These civilizations also likely monitor other primitive civilizations as well. Two of these advanced civilizations here seem to have a degree of geopolitical tension and may have fought wars in the past. I base this on some abductee reports of the human-type aliens and reptilians 
disliking each other quite a bit. One of these civilizations could be hostile but may be kept in check by others. Its likely these civilizations may have fought wars against each other in the past. 

One or more of these civilizations also has some form of extradimensional technology as well. They also maintain several ""observation posts"" here on Earth and elsewhere in our solar system. These posts are probably self sufficient to a degree which could be why we don't see ships entering and leaving our solar system. 

The hybrid program as reported by abductees has many agendas. Some are here to integrate and act as the alien version of HUMINT operatives. Others are to seed other worlds with life and observe how they grow and evolve. Others work on the ships for whatever reasons. The aliens seem to have an interest in taking plants and animals as well. With the numerous reports I think its possible they take them in order to create new plant and animal life to seed on other worlds. I think some ""mass vanishings"" of villages and civilizations in the past may be mass abduction by aliens possibly done to seed other worlds with civilizations or to work with the alien groups in unknown goals. 

I think each civilization here is acting upon their respective governments and interests. Some of these civilizations may have ""factions"" which work against the geopolitical interests of the main governing body of the alien civilizations. One of the civilizations here is likely stronger than the rest which prevents the others from exerting too much influence here. 

This is all speculation on my part. ive done some research and listened to people who have done more extensive research than I have. I've listened to Preston Dennett, Dr. John Mack, Dr. David Jacobs,  Robert Dean, Kathleen Marden and a variety of experiencers ive talked to.

What if the position the government finds itself in is that we are witnessing a 4th dimensional conflict play out, and we aren’t really able to conceptualize the conflict. There could be many things we just can’t comprehend about what might be happening as we only get the 3 dimensional perspective. 

To anybody that has trouble thinking about the 4th dimension (not time) this award winning video is a really good resource, if you stick around to the end it even shows how 4 dimensional objects would look in 3 dimensions, you may see some familiar shapes

946,aliens,I've always wondered what happens to a species when they ultimately have figured everything out? When there's nothing left to discover?,"Has anyone else ever wondered? We the human race are built on progression. Making the the models of something. Improving. Discovering the stars and universe. Discovering our own abilities and capabilities. 
One day we will advance so far. Have scoured the entitr galaxy and found all there is to find. Learned all there is to learn. Maybe even met the creator himself of this whole thing? Or found out consciousness is the creator of this all. Whatever it is. Once we've covered every base. Made every piece of tech possible and have nothing else to learn? What happens? From there. And I think this is a deep question to say the least. 

I mean we can continue to experiment through the galaxy. But let's say we been there and dome that in every way shape and form. There literally is nothing new to be had. Seen or made. Does a species become depressed as a whole? With nothing to look forward to what's the point? Complacent? Obviously cause there is no more progression. Honestly when you think of this its quite depressing. I wouldn't wanna live in a world where there's nothing to be excited about. Nothing to find. No mystery or wonder anymore. Everything is perfect and flaws don't exist. 

Would a species revert itself? Say find a planet colonize it and then revert back to times or not pass knowledge down and just do it all over again? Just so some part of the human race has that sense of wonder and exploration. 

I've always wondered what others thought about this and thier takes.",rk6vxj,13,,1639951179.0,29,0.79
947,aliens,"A possible explanation for greys/aliens having humanoid forms - Carcinisation, Nature has evolved creatures into crabs 5 times in a case of convergent evolution","[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinisation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinisation)

This may explain why highly intelligent lifeforms from other planets appear to be humanoid. It could be a preset within evolution where humanoids appear eventually in highly intelligent lifeforms. Convergent Evolution is the best argument for Grey Aliens being from other planets yet appearing the same as us (outside of the hybrid theory)

edit: **please don't try to make me justify this theory. its just one of many possible theories to muse on. not one i subscribe to or hedge any bets on. its just another angle that this problem can be looked at from to broaden our thoughts**",rk6ddj,436,,1639949741.0,140,0.93

949,aliens,Why do aliens hide?,"My opinion after studying for over 20 years this subject, and analysing the phenomenom:

Introducing themselves on a global scale would present a confound to their scientific studies of the development of our species - as it would doubtless change the way humans behave in a transgenerational sense",rk4oaw,19,,1639944775.0,98,0.77
950,aliens,UFOs and Math,"As I was watching a video about physics and space, it touched on the history of humans mathematically modelling our solar system and how when we were modelling the solar system we discovered that in order to create a completely accurate model, we essentially needed to model the entire universe's interactions, or at least account for them, because when we modelled how celestial bodies interact with earth, we realized that these celestial bodies weren't just interacting with other celestial bodies in our solar system, but with every other object in the universe - every object exerts a non-zero force on every other object.

&nbsp;

The fact that every object is interacting with every other object opens up a lot of terribly curious possibilities, we can currently create models of celestial bodies that can accurately predict future behavior; we are always learning new things about how the universe works and interacts with itself, but imagine if we knew more, if we had a much more comprehensive and thorough understanding of the world around us, from every level of existence from the smallest subatomic particles to the grander movements of galactic bodies. Imagine if we had such a complete understanding of physics that we could create much much more accurate models of future scenarios, if our understanding of existence was thorough enough, we could possibly create predictions of life and its complex interactions that could become very accurate; we already do this to a certain extent in data science; analyzing data and gaining insight into things by analyzing vast amounts of data and seeing trends that would otherwise be unknown to us.

 &nbsp;

If we look at the future as a complex mathematical model of possible scenarios as opposed to a time that can be travelled to and from, we can view the UFO phenomenon in an interesting and practical way which frames a possible perspective on the behavior and characteristics of the phenomenon that fits in current human understanding of time and physics.

 &nbsp;

It is possible that what we are seeing if the occupants of UFOs appear to be 4th dimensional beings or humans/aliens from the future with super advanced tech allowing them to time travel is actually all just math. It would explain how their plan/behavior is not perfect but they still may have complex understandings of how the future may unfold, while also having to interact with others of their kind that have the same

 &nbsp;

It opens up the possibility that occupants of UFOs may have the ability to model future scenarios in meaningful ways to determine how to interact here and now, with individual humans, civilizations, their environments, etc. If their technology, or biological level of development, was advanced enough they may be able to work and interact with these scenarios mentally or externally through technology in order to form thorough and well constructed plans of action; that would then allow them to influence events in a significant way.

 &nbsp;

If this is true and they have significantly more advanced brains relative to humans allowing them to process a significant amount of these scenarios internally - how would that change how they are? How would they interact differently with us, with each other? Their nature as a species would totally change; imagine how fast and drastically human civilization, and human individuals, would change if we could have all of our potential social interactions effectively mapped out, all of the possibilities for how things could possibly develop and turn out; all in a way that we could understand and process, while every individual or group you interact with is also doing the same thing, not just socially but political, economic, military, culturally, scientific etc. 

&nbsp;

If a civilization could meet a point like this, and even looking at the information/tech. change humans have undergone over the last 80 years, its not unreasonable that even just basic communication, as we do it, may have significant barriers and obstacles. How we use our language to interact with such a society would have to adapt, we would have to understand that they are communicating in a fundamentally different way.",rk4579,19,,1639943233.0,4,0.82
