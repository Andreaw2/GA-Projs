3,conspiracytheories,Prediction for what will happen in the world within the next 5 years. (Urgent must read!)," 

I believe though the Ukrainians will put up a brave fight they will ultimately lose to Russia unfortunately. But this is not the significant part of this event (though it is important) the real thing to watch here is Germany and the European Union.

Germany this week has completely just forgot about decades of ant-militarism. They have raised their military budget to 100 Billion euros for 2022/2023. Now this is huge. This means Germany is quickly rising as a military power again. This is happening and not receiving anywhere near as much attention as this should. Everyone knows the history of German and where German militarism can lead. Something is clearly in the works behind the scenes here (I'm not sure what but it is very sinister in nature). Russia's invasion of Ukraine has pushed Germany back onto the world scene as a military power (about to have the 3rd largest military budget).

Europe is quickly becoming very united as America is falling very quickly.

I predict that a Holy Roman Empire will rise in Europe within the next few years (and this may be worse than the Third Reich). I predict that the EU will shrink down to 10 European nations.

This union in fact it may not be the EU but there will be a unification of 10 European nations I believe.

Now at the moment all that is needed for this to happen is a German stong man to come onto the scene. Once this happens Germany will become extremely aggressive.

It seems the entire purpose of this war was to allow Germany an excuse to become powerful again.

Now here is where my prediction takes a bit of a leap.

I predict that Germany will betray the US.

Yes, you heard that correctly.

I believe Germany will ultimately conquer the weakened America and the weakand United Kingdom.

Germany/Europe will be the New world super power and this war in Russia/Ukraine is setting the stage for exactly that.

Russia/China/India:

Russia and China are already forming an alliance today. I believe that Russia, China, and India will form an alliance. Now I don't think Russia or China will directly attack the US I believe it will be more of a psychological warfare sort of a cold war. They will definitely aid in the weakening of the US. India is already beginning to show signs of becoming distanced from the US.

I need to flesh this though out a bit more about Russia/China/India but this is my general idea

Now regarding Germany and the Middle east.

I believe that America leaving Afghanistan set the stage for Europe to step in (a German led Europe). Ultimately Germany will conquer Iran and at some point they will likely also surround Israel.

(this is mainly just an educated guess though)

The New West (Europe) vs. The east

The east (Russia, China, and India likely led by Russia so I suspect at some point a weakening in China's power or at least Xi Jinping's power)

The new west will have a battle against the east at some point. And at the beginning the west will be winning but ultimately the east will crush them. This is where my prediction/theory ends.

But the future for the English speaking countries is looking very bad to say the least freedom will definitely be a thing of the past.

this may make sense or just seem like the ramblings of a madman I'll let you decide

If you think this makes sense then share it.

11,conspiracytheories,Anyone else have reservations towards Michael Saylor?,"TL;DR -- Just my speculation, once again. All of Michael Saylor's interviews are sales pitches that are cocooned from actual criticism. It almost sounds like Michael is pushing a new religion. And while I think Bitcoin will eventually become the new reserve for all global currencies, who/what do you think is driving this agenda, and driving Michael Saylor?

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hey everyone, so my last post relating to my skepticism of Elon Musk was, much to my surprise, well-received. I was in awe with how popular skepticism towards Elon was in the conspiracy communities. I thank you all for the upvotes!

If we can cautiously assume Tesla (and all of her subsidiaries) are government-owned (such as through funds like BlackRock) and/or is a manufacturing arm of a domestic (or foreign) intelligence agency, I hate to say that it truly does not inspire my confidence in the truth of what Bitcoin is, considering Tesla and Elon are pushing for it. Which leads me to Bitcoin and Michael Saylor, in my next edition of ""Anyone else?"".

So, anyone else have reservations towards Michael Saylor?

Aside from the usual caution issued towards today's leading billionaires, a lot of Michael Saylor's devotion to Bitcoin appears as religious devotion, with many logical fallacies that Patrick Bet-David attempted to expose, yesterday, near the end of his podcast ""interview"" with Michael. I put interview in quotes, because if anyone has ever watched any of Michael's interviews, he leaves no room for meaningful conversations, one of his many manipulative tactics used to shield his long-winded sales pitches from actual criticism.

I truly wish to know what (read: who) motivates Michael Saylor's exceptionally strong desire, and time, to disseminate his suffocating monologues at the grass roots level, with all the time that he seemingly has to appear on quite a number of relatively smaller podcasts.

Now USA warned Ukraine early and the western world is helping to ruin Russia economically while supporting Ukraine defending themselves. Of course no NATO Member can officially send troops because of the fear of nuclear armageddon.

Maybe, just maybe, i was thinking, the US planed this all along, pushing Ukraine in that position, not risking NATO members/soldiers, to finally start the downfall of Putins empire.

# The Bogdanoffs, Servants of Byelobog

So first I will begin with the Bogdanoff's part in all of this. The Bogdanoffs are, as we know, were creatures of higher intelligence, thanks to knowing exactly what happened before and during the Big Bang. How would they know this?

Well let me explain.

If you are Slavic, you will understand the meaning of the name ""Bogdanoff"", being ""God-Given's-Son"". Why does this matter? One of the most important Gods in the Slavic Pantheon was Byelobog, the High-God, and one of the other more popular and famous deities being Chernobog. They are a dualist, Byelobog representing Life, Light and Day, and Chernobog present Darkness, Night and Death.

But how does this all connect? The Bogdanoffs were actually Servants of Byelobog. They never ""died"", they merely went back to heaven via the World Tree, to inform Byelobog of the continuation of the ritual which was meant to bring Chernobog back unto the world.

Which leads me to...

# Chernobog, Chernorus, Chernobyl

And this is where it all ties together, do you remember Chernobyl? Or Chernorus? How about how it ties in with CHERNOBOG?

Chernobyl was no mere ""Nuclear Meltdown"". Mere human minds weren't able to comprehend Peklo/Pakao coming onto the earth, and men of science of the Soviet Union rationalized it as a ""Nuclear Meltdown"". In reality, it was a dark ritual made by the servants of Chernobog to bring him back, but the influence of Byelobog was still yet too strong for him to return, so he ran off and left chunks of Peklo/Pakao behind (elephant's foot) which were too magic for human minds to comprehend, thus we interpreted it as radioactivity. 

And what is ""Chernorus""? During the Russian Civil War, the region of the Ukraine was often called ""Black Russia"", or ""Chernorus"". It was called so because, unlike Belarus, they were ***anarchists***. Belarus and The White Army, or should I say, the Army of Byelobog, fought hard against both the Atheist Red-Russians, and the clearly Chernobog serving Black-Russians. 

The victory of the Soviet Union was, in the end, a pyrrhic victory for the forces of Byelobog. As it prolonged the ritual, and stopped Black Russia from taking over and finally defeating the forces of Byelobog once and for all.

# The Invasion of Ukraine

Now this is where it all begins to tie together. Know the hit game series, S.T.A.L.K.E.R.? It is based in Chernobyl and Pripyat mostly, and based off of Strugatsky's ""Roadside Picnic"". Strugatsky was actually a Priest of Chernobog, and was told of these ""Higher Creatures"" which left magical artefacts in Chernobyl. This is true, seeing as the Elephant's Foot existed, which was a chunk of Peklo/Pakao that was so powerful magically, that is became the most """"""radioactive"""""" thing in the world.

And as we all know, S.T.A.L.K.E.R. is in development. What if I told you this was one of the many ways that the followers of Chernobog worship their God in Black-Russia? Because what you do is you collect artefacts to sell them to """"""collectors"""""" (servants of Chernobog), and in the first game go to the ""Wish Granter"" in the True Ending, and find out the C Consciousness was behind it all along. 

It is no mere game, but an indoctrination program to teach young disciples of how they will defeat Byelobog. Allow me to elaborate.

The Noosphere is a layer which covers all human emotions, and the C-Consciousness tried to edit it basically to rid the world of negative emotions. These ""Negative Emotions"" are clearly referring to Chernobog, and how the Priests of Byelobog are trying to eliminate the evil that is Chernobog once and for all. This insinuates that the ""Wish Granter"" was a cover for the Priests. 

Should S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 be released, it is clear that Peklo/Pakao would once again resurface, and the ritual would be carried out in the very heart of the Chernobyl Reactor.

Therefore, Putin, a manifestation of Perun, the Slavic God of War, stepped in after the Bogdanoffs (servants of Byelobog, if you weren't paying attention) returned to Raj/Rai and warned Perun about the incoming ritual.

The fucking Taliban said Russia was too aggressive against civilians, China said the respect Ukraines freedom, (Ukraine responded by saying the respects Taiwans freedom, lol!) 

Trump has been very quiet. Now again, not saying he HAS to chime in. I understand if he had his Twitter he’d probably be talking his head off. Is he active on “Truth Social”, Gab or Telegram?

Last week I stopped by my son's house to pick up my grandson, and when he came out to my car, he was carrying a folder full of pictures of somebody that looked exactly like I did in the 70s but dressed up in military uniform. The folder also contained several files on this person which I read through. It turns out that the military had tested an ungodly amount of experimental psychedelic drugs on this person in hopes of finding a drug which would allow them to control people's minds. After about 8 years of constant testing, this person was deemed completely out of his mind and kicked to the curb. There was a note in the folder with a quote from one of the government doctors saying ""I have never before in my life seen such a crazy man. He speaks to the toilet in the test chamber as of it is alive, he calls it mr.schnickles. He has also done things like, strip down naked, cut a hole in the side of his mattress, and climb inside claiming that it was 'the portal the the land of the fluffy creatures' I fear that the testing has done severe permanent damage to his mind.""


I know for a fact that this person was not me because first of all, I'm not crazy, second of all, they never would have let me into the military back then because I was constantly doing drugs, and third I know that the government tracks every single movement that I make, it would have been extremely easy for them to collect some of my DNA at any point of their choosing and use it to clone me, so that explains why this person looks like me.",t29ngj,29,,1645916728.0,274,0.57

The Clintons hired Latham Watkins during their 2016  election. Michael Sussman is an attorney at Latham & Watkins’, currently accused of lying to the FBI about Russian Collusion in 2016 leading to the many impeachment inquiries. He’s also the person who received illegal surveillance documents from Rodney Joffe. Joffe collected the documents During the Trumps presidency. 
https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/lawyer-firm-represented-clinton-campaign-indicted-special-counsel/story?id=80065406

Halyna Hutchins (From Ukraine) was coincidentally and accidentally murdered 10/21/2021 by Alec Baldwin. She was married to an attorney at Watkins Latham,where Sussman worked. An interesting side note. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halyna_Hutchins

Rodney Joffe is likely a CIA or FBI subcontractor operating under SecurityMagazine.com where he’s a “Author”. This is FASCINATING webpage by the way, worth digging around. I had a LOT of questions about their events page. 
https://www.securitymagazine.com/events 

He’s also the Sr VP of an International Security Counsel called Neurostar. Neurostars webpage gives me a really weird vibe. No names ANYWHERE. https://www.nisc.neustar

 He also co-authored a ‘Lessons Learned’ document with DHS, which still serves as the Best Practices handbook for cyber-attack response. This Lessons Learned document can be found on Google, but I couldn’t get the page to load.

I have a feeling he is terminally ill, he previously undergone surgery for cancer(allegedly) as reported [here](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8970989/amp/Vladimir-Putin-underwent-surgery-cancer-February-critic-claims.html) by a political analyst and of course Russia denied those claims(sth for which they are notoriuos)

Secondly he seems to have gained weight mainly in his face(which might be water retention caused by immuno-suppressants, i know because my sister had simillar symptoms when she took them) and also he seems to wear a lot of make up(he wants to cover up something)

I didn't keep up with putins news but he seems odd like his ill or maybe I'm crazy. But he does look off when I saw him make his speeches. So maybe he is ill and he wants to try go in books as a great leader of russia and try and recreate the former strength and might of USSR. Because he has been in power for a long time and he controls everything and no one can really power check him. So maybe in his head with all these years of personal power and Russia slowing losing influence in the region and whatever has happend to him he just wants to show the world his power.

Welcome to the Trans Zone. Where a tiny religious Cult has convinced the liberal majority of the world that biological sexual binary is a myth. In the Trans Zone, parents come to accept that the only way their child can survive a rough transition through puberty is the complete and total body modification of said child, to imitate the form associated with the desired sex (while firmly believing that sexual duality is a myth). 

Voicing conflicting beliefs, or questioning the logic of The Myth, results in immediate cancellation, in order to avoid the ""social contagion"" of free & rational thought. Not onboard with ending your genetic line before your child is fully developed (mind & body)? You'll be labeled a ""Transphobe"" or ""TERF"" so all will know to dismiss any questions you manage to voice. After all, nothing matters more than the feelings of children during puberty. All Hail the Great & Powerful Myth! /s

For those wondering at the connection; Autism has a significantly disproportionate representation in the adolescent Trans Community. Polls in Autistic spaces show over 70% of online Autistics identify as Transgender or nonbinary.",syrmso,1,,1645547224.0,0,1.0

101,conspiracytheories,12 reasons why Flat Earth Theory is a government-run psychological operation,"**The Millennium Report: What I see with this flavor of psychological operation is a dividing of the conspiracy demographic, and heavily discrediting the flat earth segment – while effectively assassinating the credibility of conspiracy truth by association.**

**The CIA has a major agenda to misrepresent and/or discredit conspiracy aware persons, as seen with their Operation Mockingbird NLP tactic of molding the societal view and weaponizing the term “conspiracy theorist” after the JFK assassination.**

# Here are 12 reasons why Flat Earth Theory is a government-run psychological operation:

1. Flat Earth is worse for credibility than nearly any other belief.
2. CIA & co-conspirators have a yearning agenda to discredit conspiracy truths and conspiracy aware people – What does flat earth do? Flat earthers are discredited to the point of near complete marginalization, and conspiracy aware people are discredited by association.
3. Predictive programming related to this new surge of flat earth material must include a demographic of people that associate irrational beliefs to general conspiracy aware people.
4. Each new piece of conspiracy truth a flat earther shares is further discredited by association.
5. Who does this surge in flat earth material tangibly benefit? It discredits conspiracy truths, so obviously it benefits those involved in a pervasive conspiracy (e.g. The CIA or perhaps any other Western intelligence agency).
6. Flat Earth discredits NASA Opposition, especially to the scientific community.
7. Making a mockery of alt media.
8. Division of conspiracy belief prone demographics (Even I’m guilty of not following a fellow truther due to flat earth being in their twitter bio).
9. Creates an environment where alt media appears absurd to the mainstream, gives a sample of irrationality to over-simplify to all conspiracy believers.
10. Flat Earth as a stratagem to divide & control the opposition.
11. Suspiciously a “group of elite business professionals” are paying popular alt media people off to promote flat earth. Something tells me this has a CIA or U.S Military tax-payer dollar amount attached to it.
12. The Flat Earth Theory was designed from the get-go to take any rational discussion into a completely irrational direction.

103,conspiracytheories,Water Sacred Geometry and the Architecture of Sound,"I am starting to think about how the different Water sacred geometries present themselves according to the different types of Sound.

During the last years, we are realising that there is a kind of hidden knowledge about it.  
One good way to make this phenomena visible is through something called “visible sound”.

Something that called my attention was an interesting quote from Johann Wolfgang von Goethe that maybe tried to reveal something at that time: “**Music** is **liquid architecture;** architecture is frozen music”. And that makes me think…. that the old constructions like Church, Castles, etc has a purpose in their architecture to generate specific sounds and frequencies!

I watched this interesting video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8tJJtwWNA4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8tJJtwWNA4)

I understand that it’s not so popular to discuss Christianity on television nowadays but it’s very strange how something so important and common not so long ago is now just gone from our tv screen. It’s just gone. Nobody is talking about it and nobody has any idea anymore.

For example, if you were to watch a modern tv show about some teenagers or typical American families, you would never hear them say, “hey we are going to church this Sunday. Wouldn’t you join us?” But until the early 2000s, it was a common thing to hear. I don’t know if I am reading too deeply into it.",sxm4dd,16,,1645423034.0,74,0.61

I just got onto YouTube and as I was scrolling advertisements for similar looking beads popped up? I haven't spoken about the beads to anyone or said anything aloud about them. I don't make any jewelry or anything of the like so I'm not sure how else the phone would've known.

122,conspiracytheories,Is Putin the Phaëthon of Platos’ Timaeus?,"
Phaethon is the son of Helios, and out of desire to have his parentage confirmed, travels to the sun-god's palace in the east. There he is recognised by his father, and asks him for the privilege to drive his chariot for a single day. Despite Helios' fervent warnings and attempts to talk him out of it, counting the numerous dangers he would face in his celestial journey and reminding Phaethon that only he can control the horses, the boy is not dissuaded and does not change his mind. He is then allowed to take the chariot's reins; his ride is disastrous, as he cannot keep a firm grip on the horses. As a result, he drives the chariot too close to the earth, burning it, and too far from it, freezing it. In the end, after many complaints, from the stars in the sky to the earth itself, Zeus strikes Phaethon with one of his lightning bolts, killing him instantly. His dead body falls into the river Eridanus, and his sisters the Heliades are turned to black poplar trees as they mourn him.

**In Plato's Timaeus, Critias tells the story of Atlantis as recounted to Solon by an Egyptian priest, who prefaced the story by saying:**

`There have been, and will be again, many destructions of mankind arising out of many causes; the greatest have been brought about by the agencies of fire and water, and other lesser ones by innumerable other causes. There is a story that even you [Greeks] have preserved, that once upon a time, Phaethon, the son of Helios, having yoked the steeds in his father's chariot, because he was not able to drive them in the path of his father, burnt up all that was upon the earth, and was himself destroyed by a thunderbolt. Now, this has the form of a myth, but really signifies a declination of the bodies moving in the heavens around the earth, and a great conflagration of things upon the earth, which recurs after long intervals`

Sun Palace of the East = Kremlin or Kumsusan Palace of the Sun (Kim Jong-un)

Fire and Water = hydrogen bombs

Declination of Celestial Bodies = nuclear weapons equipped satellites raining down on earth and long range intercontinental ballistics missiles from various sites and submarines that shoot up into space.


Or 

Phaëthon could be a sunburst from the sun (Helios) that burns and freezes earth and is nullified later by electromagnetism (Zeus)?


Or

Phaëthon could be a planet (Niburu/Planet-X) of a brown dwarf (Dead Helios)  near our galaxy that rides down to earth (orbits) close enough to burn everything and far enough to freeze it by flipping our poles, there is an account that the great flood happens after Phaethon is struck by Zeus.",swtdq6,0,,1645333523.0,8,0.5

133,conspiracytheories,Dinosaurs Did Not Exist,"Here are my current findings:

    ***Possible rebuttal: dinosaurs were around for newrly 170 million years -> lots of time for evolution*** BUT, sharks have been around for even longer, and aren’t as diverse. some sources claim that this is because dinosaurs evolved quickly, but that doesn’t really happen. evolution is a long and slow process. even then, they got to the point where they were essentially different animals entirely.
	1.	Too many variations/species. No other animal is this diverse. Dinosaurs range from T-Rex’s to plant-eating dinosaurs to pterodactyls. Some walked, some mostly swim, some even flew. Some were carnivores, some were herbivores, and some were omnivores. No other animal has this diverse of species.

	2.	They were just too big. Some were as long as blue whales and around half a blue whale’s weight, however, blue whales are oceanic creatures. The tallest current land animal is a giraffe, which can reach up to 18 feet tall. The longest dinosaur was nearly 85 long. Elephants can be around 13,000 lbs, the heaviest dinosaur was roughly 10x heavier than this. There is no way these land animals were THAT much bigger.

	3.	Ties in with the previous point, there couldn’t have been enough food to go around. They were just way too massive and would’ve had to eat a crazy amount to sustain their size. The planet had much more oxygen and was much more lush back then, but even then, herbivores could not have eaten enough leaves/plants to sustain so many of them at such a massive size. Carnivores and omnivores also would’ve had to have eaten a significant amount and there just isn’t any way that could’ve happened.

	4.	Way too many theories on how they became extinct (volcano, meteor, flood etc.) which could’ve been to get people to argue about that, rather than if they were even real or not in the first place.

	5.	***NOT SUPER FACT BASED*** Just think about dinosaurs…doesn’t even seem very plausible, does it?

	6.	We’re just told as kids that dinosaurs and we don’t question it because we’re kids. Also, kids think dinosaurs are cool, so they’re even more inclined to believe in them. This is similar to things like Santa, the Tooth Fairy, the Easter Bunny etc., however, there’s no really way to discover that dinosaurs because we don’t even consider it and they’re not in our everyday lives.

Things that need to be addressed:

BIGGEST CONCERN: bones (probably didn’t fake them, but maybe they used large moulds?)

Possible disasters or global happenings around the early 1800’s (dinosaur fossils claim to have been discovered in 1824 by William Buckland)

Motives for faking dinosaurs?: Maybe they needed people to move there (kind of like the Loch Ness Monster)?

Side note: William Buckland was known to eat mice on toast, porpoise, panther, even puppies, AND ate a king’s heart; a.k.a. not sure if he can be trusted.

The Bible claims that the Genesis Flood wiped out dinosaurs, but science says dinosaurs were around hundreds of millions of years ago, not a few thousand. However, religious people will just say, “the Bible says this so…”

136,conspiracytheories,Mutually assured destruction isn't for other countries,"When against an enemy that you can't beat, you need to change the game, and that's what we did. Over many  years, we started to discover things that we couldn't quite understand, until.. we did, and, as always, we wanted more. Here's the story, or how the story goes, if you believe in these kinds of things.

Now, One big thing to understand is that people were connected in history more than it would appear. Everyone worth anything pretty much knew or could get in contact with anyone else worth while. Very likely, secret clubs conspiracy.

Germany was the first country to get a major break from the technology, and that propelled their war effort. However, this left a question on the minds of the scientists. ""Who does this tech belong to?"" Here's where Hitler comes into play. You see, he was simply a tool to access funding. Research isn't free and it takes time, but above all, you need people out there doing work, finding & testing things. Why be the guy in charge, when you can be the guy controlling the guy in charge type of thing. War provided ample funding for exploring nearly every part of the world, in detail, and allowed us to bring together some of the top minds from around the world, and reverse engineer some incredible technology that lead to some amazing inventions. Plus you have the added benefit of hiding under the disguise of war, but there was still a problem.. Where did the tech come from.

After the war started to come to an end, and most of the scientists and people in charge changed addresses, we were left with the technology to build huge bombs, which we dropped, and they worked, but this caught the attention of another perceived threat. The story I've been told implies interdimensional, that relates to CIA projects, missing 411, ocean aliens, bigfoot, giants, aliens, abductions, greys, reptiles and many more.. However, it can really be anything, but imagine it this way. If you're outside walking on the sidewalk and you see one ant colony has a mushroom cloud over their hill and a neighboring ant colony is building bombs, you might go check what's up. This ultimately lead to a ton of abductions and disappearances and high level meetings, which prompted the US/Germany super team to come up with a defense. Nuclear arms race. Every lie starts with a little truth, and the truth was that the nuclear weapons would stop a threat, and the message would be clear. Leave us alone or we destroy literally everything.

Well, to a degree, it worked. We staged the enemy in Russia, and gave them bombs. All while funding and support was pouring in for a fake war. Bombs we're being built and strategically placed around the world under the disguise that each country was doing this to attack the other incase they invaded. One thing about humans is they are not to be messed with, there is a utter lack of regard for life, that is nearly animalistic. Imagine a crocodile that is smarter than you, faster than you, doesn't care about you, will hunt you for fun, works in teams, and will hang your head on a wall, all because ""Tuesday afternoon's are boring"", Just living isn't enough for these people, and that's how they describe us.

It wasn't until 1954 that a deal was formed that allowed for technology advancements in medicine, communications, travel and more, for the benefit of being able to abduct humans & animals for their studies, without the need for really big bombs to explode, which is supposed to be limited to specific areas, such as national parks (hot spots). Trading control for information to get more control essentially. Anyway, I've been told this deal lasts until 2029, at which point, ""we will finally be ready"" (not sure what this last part means, but it's similar to a caterpillar/butterfly and has always stuck with me). This is to be proceeded by an influx of new technology, that will make us more machine like, allowing us longevity for the trade of humanity.

Anyway, it has been awhile since I've heard or told this story, but I think I was able to remember the bulk of it. Also, if anyone from you know what agency asks about me, I'm crazy, and do drugs and NOT a legitimate source.",svvwy9,4,,1645227882.0,4,0.75
137,conspiracytheories,"Were Adam And Eve actually souls, and the fruit from the tree of LIFE, gave them human bodies?","What I actually believe is that Adam and Eve were souls and they were the first twin flames... Twin flames are where a soul is split into two halves and goes into two seperate bodies, the two people will meet eachother at some point then go through certain stages and lessons in life where they will eventually unite and stay together forever and the two people as well as their two souls become one, and once they die, their two halves of the souls become one whole soul again, if they don't reach union in the life that they meet, then they reincarnate into their next life into different human bodies, and go through the whole process again, and they will keep reincarnating everytime until they finally reach union...

So I think this is what Adam and Eve were.

When God says Eve was made from Adam, I think this is meaning that Adams soul was split into two and the second half became Eve, but I think they were just souls in space, with no bodies, hence why they felt no pain, no sadness etc.

I think when Eve was tempted, she was tempted by fruit from the tree of LIFE, and i think she was tempted to go into a human body and then obviously because her and Adams souls are the same, he would have had to have come into a human body too, and then the twin flame process would have started for them.

This is why I believe they started to feel pain, sadness, they could sin etc, because they were now in human bodies, as souls when they are in the spirit realm, cannot sin or feel pain etc, this is why I also think they were shocked to discover they were naked, as previously, they were souls with no bodies, and they were shocked at their nakedness because they were seeing their human body for the first time... 

A lot of people believe that God is like an energy, a soul, a spirit, rather than being a human, and Adam and Eve were created in God's image, and if God was a soul, spirit or energy, then Adam and Eve would have been too if they were created to be just like God, which also confirms that they would have just been souls to start off with ..",svtsmj,63,,1645221939.0,34,0.82

140,conspiracytheories,Psychology Dissertation,"Hi everyone!

I am a psychology student at university and am currently in my last year of study. Because of this I am completing a dissertation and would love for some of you to be participants!

The study will be looking at different aspects of why some people believe in conspiracy theories whilst others do not.

To participate all you would have to do is complete an online questionnaire that will take approximately 20-30 minutes (But you can take breaks while completing the questionnaire if you would like to).

Your identity and results will be completely anonymous as the questionnaire does not ask for your name or other information about you, and you can withdraw at any time!

The only requirements to make you eligible to take part is that you are aged 18 years or over, and currently live in the UK.

I would really appreciate it if anyone would like to participate and would also like to make it clear that the aim of this study is not to judge or disprove any views that participants have. All participants would be treated with complete respect no matter what their views on conspiracy theories are.

If you have any questions you would like to ask about this study you can email me at [19000959@hope.ac.uk](mailto:19000959@hope.ac.uk).

Again I would be grateful if anyone would like to take part. Thanks!

178,conspiracytheories,What if the invasion of Ukraine is a plan between the United States and Russia?,"Edit: Lmao, thanks for the flair, better than gold

So I was thinking, was if the current situation between Russia and Ukraine is actually backed by the United States? My thought goes a little like this: Russia threatens to invade Ukraine, America puts on a show telling them to back off. Now Russia is adamant and decides to invade Ukraine, and America under the pretext of the current situation of the failure in Afghanistan, Inflation, COVID, and political disunion, does not declare war and simply imparts sanctions with Russia. This shows great weakness of the American Superpower, and shows that a country like Russia can get away with the invasion of another country. This leads to the Chinese. China seeing a weakened America, decides to retake Taiwan, after all, Russia took Ukraine without much a fuss. So we have a repeat of the situation currently, but this time it is China preparing to invade Taiwan, except this time when they do America and friends actually declare war, and not only that, Russia does too, after all they have East Asian influence to gain over this. America has so much to gain from China’s demise, they’re their main economic rival. So with all the countries fighting against China it is almost a guaranteed victory. Russia gets a more secure border with the newly annexed Ukraine and new lands in the east, and America gets their main rival broken up (probably what would happen, considering China’s history of breaking up into multiple nations)

““This is significant trauma,” said Dr. Gavin Britz, the chair in neurosurgery at Houston Methodist. “This is something I find with someone with a baseball bat to the head, or who has fallen from 20 or 30 feet.”
Dr. Britz noted that the autopsy described fractures to particularly thick parts of the skull, as well as to bones in the roof of the eye socket. “If you fracture your orbit,” he said, referring to those eye bones, “you have significant pain.”
The knock ruptured veins in the space between the membrane covering the brain and the brain itself, causing blood to pool, the autopsy indicated. The brain, secured in a hard skull, has nowhere to move, doctors said, and the result is a compression of brain centers critical for breathing and other vital functions.
No alcohol or illegal drugs were detected in the actor’s system, according to the autopsy. But there were signs of Clonazepam, commonly known as Klonopin, a benzodiazepine that is used to prevent seizures and treat panic attacks.

I have reason to believe that Micheal Jackson never existed. First of all, in every video that I have ever seen, every time that they said Micheal Jackson was going to come on stage (who was supposedly a black male) a pale white woman would come out and sing in a hideously high pitched voice, so nobody has ever actually seen Michael Jackson.
My second reason is that they say that he invented the ""moonwalk"". This makes no sense to me. Even if this was true, just because Michael Jackson walked all over the moon doesn't mean that this white woman walking backwards is now walking on the moon. On top of this, what person in their right mind would go around blabbing about how they walked on the moon. The moon is horrible enough from a distance, I can only imagine what would happen if somebody walked on it. 
And the third reason is a doozy.
In the last three years, I have sent Michael Jackson many invitations to my birthday parties (I have a few every year) knowing that the only reason that he wouldn't show up would be that he didn't exist. He never showed up to any of my parties. But just to make sure that I was correct, I sent him a letter requesting that he throw me a surprise birthday party. In this request, I told him the time and place the party should be held. When I showed up 30 minutes later, there was no party.

The benefits of circumcision have been proven so we’re not having this debate. 

You may have noticed, particularly online, a rise in groups against the practice. I have a theory these are bots planted by the medical industry, let me tell you why. 

So you might think that “why would they want that? They make money from the surgery!” And while that may be true, it’s really a secret investment to have a portion of the population uncut. 

First off, sure they make a quick buck when the baby is born, but why not wait 12 years, force the family to buy their kid steroid creams, and minor surgeries before ultimately paying for the circumcision? Not to mention the antibiotics for his UTIs and the easier spread of STDs. 

Next is the fact, women prefer clean, circumcised men. This is a statistically proven fact. Having a portion of the population uncut reduces the options for women and leaves more men alone. This will drive the use of anti depressants and the need for therapists even more. 

Anti circumcision is just another subtle push for more profit.",sqta2d,0,,1644677822.0,13,0.16

199,conspiracytheories,Serial Killers are not who we have been led to believe,"Nothing surprises me anymore.

I read a book months ago that stated ""serial killers"" are not who we think they are. The media brands serial killers as lone wolfs, deranged individuals with a lust for blood, but the book I read stated that many of the so-called serial killers did not act alone, were in fact members of CIA-sponsored cults, were possibly trained or brainwashed assassins with high level connections to CIA/Intelligence or political communities. It was a fascinating book but I'm unsure of how much truth there is to the author's thesis.

Let's be honest - the lone wolf, deranged killer branding is ""sexy"" and it generates views, sells books, etc.  The ""deranged lone wolf"" branding may be just that, branding only. 

Is it that far fetched to think serial killers didn't actually act alone and may have been paid hitmen? It's been proven that Ted Bundy, Henry Lee Lucas, etc many of the serial killers had very high level political connections, were members of cults etc. Was there only one Boston Strangler? Only one Hillside Strangler? 

The book stated that many of the victims were in fact contract hits and usually executed by multiple individuals/groups and not the lone wolf individual like media portrays.

217,conspiracytheories,"2004 most deadly earthquake & tsunami caused by ""IceCube"" underground neutrino detector at the south pole","I've been doing some research but can't seem to find any evidence of it happening, but I heard someone who once worked for the IceCube Neutrino Detector underneath the south pole talking about how he was hired on to the job as a temporary worker and all was not as it seemed with this machine. Like all government funded scientific projects, there is going to be a face value explanation for what a device or project may be used for, however, as if we all didn't know this already, when it comes to our government in the US, AND our military industrial complex, there is a lot more complexity and unspoken goals and uses surrounding these technologies and projects.

If you are unfamiliar with neutrino detectors I will post a link here so you can catch up on what these devices are SUPPOSED to do.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IceCube_Neutrino_Observatory



Now if you're caught up with me, I'd like to discuss what experiences this man shared. I won't be able to get too specific as I don't know all the details nor do I know word for word what he said , what I do remember is him talking about how he trekked out to the underground facility at the south pole, and when he got there he was briefed on the project, device, as well as his job for the next few weeks to months. 

He explains everything seems normal as they are studying the neutrinos coming from all directions, passing through material objects, trying to get some sort of detection on how the universe has evolved over the millennia. As he goes on, he explains that days or weeks later he observed a certain breaker switch which was not supposed to be on ""according to his understanding"", he explains that this particular switch controls whether they are receiving and observing these particles, or ALTERNATIVELY, BEAMING OUT PARTICLES INSTEAD. As he was confused he decided to ask a higher up why the switch was on and whether it should even be. The response he got was very short, and most disregarding. They basically told him to do his job and not worry about it.

 Fast forward to the next day, he overhears some higher ups talking about how a large earthquake followed by massive tsunamis struck a country all the way across the earth, and how it could possibly have something to do with the detector. Sure enough, he looks at the news and finds that a magnitude 9+ earthquake struck in the Indian ocean, followed by a series of 30-100 ft tall tsunami waves, caused by a huge fault line that was disturbed. I will link the wiki page here if you would like to look into how much destruction this quake caused, as it is top 5 worst and most deadly quakes in our history on this earth, killing nearly 250,000 people in total.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2004_Indian_Ocean_earthquake_and_tsunami


Edit:  since everyone is saying detectors are passive pieces of equipment, in the story I clearly describe a breaker switch which transfers the device from ""detector"" to ""emitter"". If 2 detectors on each side of the earth are switched to dispersing beams or waves instead of detecting particles, these ""neutrino detectors"" can target anywhere between their field of range, that could be anywhere from one side of the earth to the other and anywhere in between, (including underground). Once this happens these ""detectors"" suddenly become seismic weapons. Little is known about neutrinos which is why experts believe it important to study them, however, they possess enough knowledge to know that these particles can be weaponized, they are just not willing to tell us of the dangers surrounding these particles and the detectors used to study them.

The rest of the story isn't as interesting as the worker in question fell sick to his stomach feeling responsible for the catastrophe, higher ups told he and his crew never to speak of the incident, and he was later discharged from the project.  Here are 5 engagement questions for the comment section. 

1.What do you guys think of this, is this a huge coverup that never saw the light of day? 
Or is it just a person telling crazy stories to get attention? 

2. Do you think it's possible our military is testing weather and geographical related weapons on the public? If yes what comes to mind?

4. How much do you think the government, shadow societies, and military industrial complex truly hide from us?

They should be outside exploring the world, not in the house staring at a screen their whole childhood. 
Puppets are political figures and celebrities. These people happen to always have drama surrounding them but this drama doesn’t do anything but distract people. That’s the power of hollywood. Donald Trump was a president AND a celebrity long before election. He was always in the news headlines during his presidency. People hated him but that was the goal. 
These distractions can keep you from thinking much deeper about life and the universe. These distractions can also motivate you to do things you usually wouldn’t do if these things weren’t put in place. Lastly, these distractions can stop you having a TRUE CONNECTION with yourself. A lot of people wanna be like eachother or do whatever trend is popular. People are motivated by what they see on the internet spanning from Netflix to Reddit.

227,conspiracytheories,All conspiracies will eventually lead to the money supplier.,"I think that if you want to figure out the endgame of conspiracy theories, you just have to follow the money because that’s what almost everyone is working for.

Of course there are few idealists who don’t work for the money but that’s a rare breed and eventually such people are rooted out by the mass who want the comfort that money brings rather than a cold poverty with idealism.

Most people are married with kids and their priority is to bring food to the table and make sure that their family is taken care of. If you go against the big man, you will likely lose your money, job, and freedom to do provide for your family. You can’t have a family if you are behind bars or worse, dead. Simply put, it’s illogical to go against the conspiracy masters whom are probably better equipped with power, knowledge, money, and manpower.

That brings a question, what can an ordinary man do about it? Sure, we can spread the word about working together to end conspiracies. But that won’t last long as the mankind will always have tyrants and manipulators who take control of the masses and the masses will soon forget their ideals and start being attracted to the money that the rich and powerful provides.

Now we have come around full circle to where we were at the beginning, the money. The money is the master of all the mankind. They used to say the oil was the money provider. World wars were fought to control the supply of that oil. Now we are at a digital age where personal data has become the new oil. And sooner or later that will change too to something else.

The real issue then is not the money itself but the structure that makes money what money is. Is fiat currency provided by the bankers the money structure that needs to be changed? If so, mankind needs to start REDEFINE what money is.

As of now, the only way for average men and women to redefine what their money should be is a use of cryptocurrency. 
I don’t want to advertise a specific cryptocurrency but I believe that a cryptocurrency chosen by the mass should ultimately free mankind from all the conspiracy that is controlled by the elites.",sov9w1,132,,1644460803.0,32,0.88

I just watched a video of a guy talking about a bracelet which was believed to be like 50,000 years old. This bracelet is interesting because it has a hole drilled into it. Like one that was made from a high powered stable drill. Something you would see in a workshop or something like that. Which brings up many questions. There could be so many different answers. Tbh I’m not smart in history and especially the history of man. But there could’ve been sort of a reset in civilization. 

There are a few tv shows that kind of explore this concept. One being The 100 to an extent. But the one that I thought was so interesting was one called The Shanara Chronicles. Don’t remember much but I know what I’m saying next is going to be major spoilers so don’t blame me if you get spoiled. So, The Shanara Chronicles is magic and shit, ogres, elves, etc, fairy tale esque type of story. Really fun show tbh. Anyway, what was really cool about it was, somewhere in the middle of the show, the characters come across this building I believe. And in the building they find all sorts of stuff, mostly photos I think. And thinking back now, I believe what they were exploring was a high school. So they explore and whatnot and it becomes apparent to the audience that there was a whole civilization before this show had even started. Long long long before. And that civilization was basically us. So technically the show is set in our future. Which is super dope and it’s a super cool concept and one that I could totally believe. Minus the fairy tale part. Though that would be cool too. 

Let me know what you think! Sorry if it was a bit tldr.

Also totally recommend that show, fun watch


Edit:
I should also add something else to this. There is a little more to the theory but can totally go without it. So tectonic plates. They’re a weird thing. I’ve failed every test on them but I think I get the basic premise. So with this theory, there is also a total “world” reset. With tectonic plates, these things basically make the world anew. But that takes millions of years I believe. I may be wrong on all that, but I think that’s definitely important to point out. Because I’ve noticed some people saying that if the civilizations before us were half as advanced as us, they would leave traces of something, anything, but not to try to deflect their theory totally, I just forgot to mention this little tidbit. So tectonic plates could possibly eat up the surface of the planet and hide everything to make the planet anew. Crazy. Correct me if I’m wrong please.",sob0h5,54,,1644404705.0,38,0.83

When he died, they didn’t know what to do, so they tried to save him, clone him, do anything to keep it going, but it didn’t work. So what do they do? They replace him, modify and mutilate the new groundhog until it looks just like Punxsutawney Phil. At first nobody bats an eye, but when people start asking questions it’s suddenly “all in good fun” and they make up purposefully ridiculous excuses to distract us from the truth. Now these new groundhogs also live short lives, and die every few years or so. So what do they do with these dead groundhogs? They can’t admit they’re dead because they’re all supposedly Punxsutawney Phil. They chop them up, hide them away somewhere they won’t be found. Dozens of groundhogs have been viciously mutilated and murdered for the sake of this holiday and nobody bats an eye. The real  Punxsutawney Phil died around the early 1890s and is rolling in his little groundhog grave watching over the atrocities committed in his name.",so3pv3,38,,1644378346.0,11,0.84

Me personally I love urban exploration and have been talking about making this trip for a long long long long time. Something about this place draws me in. Especially since all the talk behind it about mind control, MK ultra, weather changing devices, and the big satellite tower that would give people migraines, nightmare's, and make wild life in the area freak the fuck out.

Before it turned into a public park and they boarded up all the buildings I read a document about people who got a chance to explore the abandoned cell tower and found rooms already boarded up they think they led to a massive network of underground tunnels. 

I'll post a link for anybody that wants to look more into it because I'm terrible at explaining and there is so much more information about this place [Here](https://roadtrippers.com/magazine/camp-hero-montauk-conspiracy-theories/)

A lot of paperwork was found shipping large amounts of food to the base way after the date they shut everything down. Definitely an interesting place and I am deadest on taking a trip here and exploring as much as possible very very soon.

And one more thing I forgot to mention. Most of the buildings are just boarded up and say no trespassing but for the satellite tower you are strictly forbidden from even getting close to that place.

252,conspiracytheories,Short essay on Q,"On Q

The longest and most expensive trial in US history happened in California in the 1980s. The McMartin family, owners of a preschool in Manhattan Beach, were charged with hundreds of counts of sexual abuse of children in their care. The case lasted 7 years and resulted in no convictions. Charges were dropped in 1990. The allegations were bazaar. People believed the family was a part of a network of satanists who used the school to acquire children for ritual abuse. They alleged there were tunnels leading from LA to Palm Springs and every day when the kids were dropped off by their parents, they were shuttled away for the rituals. There were claims that witches had been seen flying around the school, that there were orgies at carwashes and airports and that Chuck Norris might be involved. Looking back, it would seem that the people of Manhattan Beach and a large percentage of Americans had lost their goddamn minds. How could cops, attorneys, judges, media figures take such nonsense seriously?  It was the height of the “satanic panic”. Millions believed that heavy metal music and Dungeons and Dragons were tools of demons used to lure kids to Satan. The poor McMartin family got trapped in the mist of this mass hysteria.

On July 16th 2015, Donald Trump announced his candidacy for president. Most people (including me) laughed it off. One group of voters, however, immediately took him seriously: Evangelical Christians. They believe Satan is real and Trump was here to save the country from him. The racism and ultranationalism laced through his speeches were interpreted as strength. Trump was a strong man, sent by God himself to defeat Hillary Clinton. Right-wing media personalities like Alex Jones caught onto this. Producing a steady stream of dehumanizing content, likening Democrats to demons, Democratic voters to demon enablers. This helped spread fanatical beliefs more into the mainstream. 

On October 28, 2017, an anonymous user with the nickname Q posted a thread on 4chan’s Politically Incorrect board, titled “Calm before the Storm,” claiming to be a government insider with “Q level” security clearance. Q claimed to have read documents proving the existence of a satan-worshiping pedophile cabal of highly influential and powerful people that secretly controls governments world wide. The cabal engages in child trafficking to in order to obtain “adrenochrome"", extracted from the blood of terrified children. Trump was fighting a secret war to stop them. The posts became known as “Q drops” Mostly a series of leading questions that prompted followers to do research in order to decode the posts. The identity of this user will probably never be known, but in December of 2018, Q moved to 8chan, a far seedier site populated by ""Incels"" and Nazis alike. There is evidence that one of the sites owners, Ron Watkins, hijacked the anonymous users credentials and began posting as Q sometime in early 2019.

The new cult began seeping out of the chan world into Reddit, Twitter and Facebook. It spread like wildfire, indoctrinating millions of otherwise ordinary people. It also became a “big tent” for conspiracy theorists. Drawing in 9-11 truthers, secret alien technology believers, Big Foot hunters, new age and holistic healing adherents ect. The COVID pandemic further fueled the fire. Q influencers and followers began spreading their beliefs that the virus was a hoax and the vaccines being developed would alter DNA, turning people into cyborgs when activated by 5G technology.  In the summer of 2020, Q followers started hitting the streets. Holding rallies under the banner of “save the children” The rallies coincided with Black Lives Matter protests and seemed to be a reaction to the movement. When a BLM protest occurred, a STC rally would follow. In my opinion, the absurdity of Q is, from one perspective, a thinly veiled attempt to justify reactionary political beliefs. It is a safe haven for bigots as well as a community of irrational, emotionally compromised people. 

On April 24th 2020 a STC rally was held in Hollywood, California. The demonstrators were joined by the Proud Boys. They wore hats and patches with terms like “Shoot your local pedophile” and “Fuck ANTIFA”. They spent the day playing security guards, harassing suspected journalists and potential counter protesters. This and similar events were precursors to the January 6th insurrection. A trinity of conspiracy theorists, white nationalists and evangelicals was forming. This allegiance has fractured the Republican party. Only a few prominent Republicans are willing to speak out against it. Trumpism had become a powerful, violent political force.

There is a common belief that Q was a psyop. I once believed this was likely because of how quickly it spread. But after digging deep into the subject, I realized the framework for it to flourish has been built over the last four decades. I was raised in an Evangelical church in Orange County, GOP capital of California. Every Sunday I would see people speaking in “tongues”, preachers putting hands on the faithful who would fall to the floor, claiming to be overwhelmed by the Holy Spirit. They believe these are the “end times” and a rapture is going to transport them to heaven. Near as I can tell, a significant portion of them whole-heartedly believe these myths. They were the driving force behind the “satanic panic”. The election of Ronald Reagan marked the beginning of the merger of politics and Evangelical Christianity.  It added a new layer to the American mythos. The founding fathers were all wise, George Washington chopped down a cherry tree, the Confederacy only wanted state rights and God hates socialism. 

The last “Q drop” was posted on December 8th 2020. It seemed like the grift was over. But as Q followers have proven again and again, their resilience to disappointment is insurmountable. I thought the movement would die before it even started. On December 4th 2016, before the first “Q drop”, Edgar Maddison Welch drove from North Carolina to Washington DC to rescue abducted children from a pizza restaurant. He fired a couple rounds from his riffle and searched the building looking for a basement. Welch soon realized he had been duped and he surrendered to the police. Pizzagate was an internet myth that inflated and burst within months. But to this day, that hashtag is used by Q followers. After the silly yet serious insurrection, followers waited anxiously for inauguration day, January 20th. They thought this must be the day for the long awaited “storm"". It passed and new theories sprouted. So on and so on. I think most of them have given up on the main Q narrative. But the community that formed around it is hard to give up. Especially because many followers have wrecked havoc on their family lives. If you want to read some heartbreaking stories, check out r/QanonCasualties on Reddit. 

It’s anyone’s guess what the next rendition of Q will look like. But, in my opinion, it’s going to be around for at least the next couple election cycles. I have some thoughts on how to combat it. Unfortunately, the estranged family and friends, who are the biggest victims of Q, have the best chance at holding the movement back. They should research the history of cults and conspiracy theories. This movement didn’t come out of a vacuum. The “drinking blood” element can be traced to ""blood libel"" detailed in “The Protocols of the Elders of Zion” a fictional anti-semitic book first published in 1903. They should arm themselves with this kind of knowledge and use it to carefully bring their loved ones back to reality. Arguing with and mocking them is ineffective. Of course, because of the fact that it has become a violent political movement, the rest of us should plan for defense accordingly. This train wreck is barreling toward fascism. That is not an exaggeration. We should do whatever it takes to protect any semblance of democracy we have left.

253,conspiracytheories,The power of Frequencies and effect in Sound: hidden knowledge from previous civilisations?," During the last years, we are realising that there is a kind of hidden knowledge from Old civilisations like Tartaria (maybe intentionally) behind Frequencies topics, etc. 

One good way to make this phenomena visible is through the Sound, also called “visible sound”. There we can see that the Sound renders different types of sacred geometry in different Frequencies levels.

Something that called my attention was a interesting quote from Johann Wolfgang von Goethe that maybe tried to reveal something at that time: “**Music** is **liquid architecture;** architecture is frozen music”. And that make me think…. that the old architecture has a purpose to create specific sounds and frequencies based on how were designed!

I watched this interesting video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X7cjS-Cf-rI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X7cjS-Cf-rI) and make me think a lot about that…

If we could remember more how Quantum physics and Quantum fields (that are surrounding us) work, we could achieve amazing things like in Old Civilisations like Tartaria!!

Hope my though can add value some of you and i am open to receive related news or knowledge i don’t know about Tartarian technology in this field yet! feel free to share! :)",sm9ie8,243,,1644186404.0,62,0.94
254,conspiracytheories,"TPTB know what the ancients knew, but they hide it from us: Solar cataclysms are real and they are coming","Have come to believe that the Sun has locked the Earth into a repeating cataclysm cycle. It is on different time scales and different levels of destruction. One is massive solar flares every 150-200years (think Carrington Event), then natural disasters (earthquakes, volcanos) every 1,500 and 3,000 years. Then massive floods every 6,000 years (think Noah). And then every 12,000 years is the big one - a solar micronova - a massive extinction event which fully changes the climate, the surface of the earth, the poles, etc... (think last Ice Age). Not everything dies obviously, but a lot of species get wiped out. 

These all have to do with the interactions of plasma, dust and electromagnetism in our solar system, galaxy and universe. 

This is why the ancients ""worshiped"" the Sun, and paid great attention to astronomy. They knew about these cycles, and how to try to survive them. Sometimes it is going underground, sometimes it is going to the mountains (high ground), sometimes it is migrating to a different country/continent, depends on where you are in the cycle. For example, look up a picture of the ancient Egyptian ankh (or ""key of life"") symbol. Now look up a photo of a solar flare. See any similarities?

Anyway the point is we might be in the middle of two of these cycles right now. One is the solar flare cycle (knock out all electrical power for an extended period of time). And the other is the micronova cycle (move away from the coasts and find some caves) because the Earth's magnetic field is weakening, the poles are shifting and the climate is getting extreme. All of these are effects from the Sun getting ready to blast us. (Also our current position in the milky way spiral) 

Some scientists know/suspect this, but the mainstream has been altered/programmed to hide it. You think the wealthy all just decided to build insane bunkers for fun? You think the military has started underground training scenarios for the heck of it? Nah, some people know what the ancients left behind. Reset. It's coming. This solar cycle ends 2030. Good chance of solar flare. The extinction event is possible in the next cycle. All well within most of our lifetimes.

257,conspiracytheories,A Christianity Theory,"Hi, first of all, I’m not sure if this has ever been told, but I have always thought about this with no outside influence. So I’d like to believe I came up with this theory. And also, I hope I don’t offend anyone with this either, mainly Christians and believers in God. Take this all with a grain of salt as I am in no way trying to mock anyone or anything. So, open your mind, and think as if you were a Christian, and just for a second, try to believe that aliens are real. Whether you believe it or not. I’m not well versed in the Bible whatsoever so forgive me if I make any mistakes at any point and feel free to correct me. In the Bible, I believe it is said that all men are created in his image and likeness. And that all men or “children” are created equal in his vision. So, we know that God created the universe. And God created us, we know all that. Now, that should also mean that since God created the universe, he would have also had to have created other beings, known as aliens to us. Obviously. These aliens, are also children of God, then. Right? But you may think that humans were created in God’s image. But no one knows what he looks like exactly. So, what if, God created these other beings across the universe in his image also. But obviously in fiction, we depict them are grey, green, slim, etc. For all we know, they could have also been created in God’s image and likeness. In the Bible, angels are depicted as eyes with a bunch of wings I think? I may be wrong on that, but God could look like anything. And we might not even be able to comprehend what we would be seeing if we were to look at him. What if he split his image into our brothers and sister across the universe? 

So, within this theory so far, we have us, god, the universe, and aliens. To further conclude this theory, let’s say that the aliens are on the same level of intelligence as us, if not higher or slightly lower. Whatever. Assuming that they also had interactions with God in biblical times as us humans did, that would mean that there would be a form of a Bible? And by assuming that, would mean that these aliens believe in the same God as us. Okay but that’s all speculation, whatever. There is never any way to know I guess. And this is all super hard to explain but hopefully you get the picture.

Now that’s basically the whole theory, aliens might believe in the same God as us! But if you want to hear a little more, keep reading.

So I was talking to my friend about this theory a few nights ago and he made some interesting points that added into the theory. So he mentioned that in heaven and hell, there are things that humans have never seen. This could be like colors that we couldn’t have seen in our mortal plane right? Sights and sounds and feelings that were never thought possible. We have limitations on our. Mortal plane, we can only see certain things, hear certain things, and so on. Now these aliens that we mentioned before, it’s a safe to assume they’re completely different than us. They see differently, hear differently, and so on. What if when we all go to heaven or hell, all our sense sort of converge into one place and everyone from across the universe can see what we are ‘meant’ to see I guess. The way God intended for us. You can think of it as a long lost sister/brother reunion.

It’s a bit botched here and there, and there may have been things that I missed from my original thinking, but that is the basic premis of it. This is also my first big post on Reddit so that might also be a reason this is so bleh. But please let me know what you think, I would like to hear your guys’ thoughts on this.",sldejc,1,,1644085732.0,15,0.53
258,conspiracytheories,Jordan Peterson has schizophrenia,"Okay, tried talking about this subject on the Jordan Peterson subreddit, only two people gave half hearted responses. Thought I would bring the substance of what I wrote up, which I tried to write in a more accommodating tone perhaps, but I didn’t want to alienate people from the facts about the man.

It is well known that Dr. Peterson in the past few years has been going through some health challenges. However, recent events have led me to speak out in caution about many troubling signs I have see in Jordan and also those I see being exacerbated.

I’ll organize my thoughts in the following way, first I will discuss signs in the past, and then present day concerns. I think before I get into the meat of the subject though, many people think of the homeless population when they think of schizophrenia. There are actually those on the schizophrenia spectrum who can have a fully functioning career, a family, a life while also being impacted by its symptoms. 

This label also doesn’t mean that anything of Dr. Peterson’s is inherently flawed, this isn’t meant dispute his philosophy, that should be done on the merits of the arguments put forth. 

The Past

Jordan is known to have been raised Christian, became quite secular before having powerful experiences that set him on the path he is now. During the Cold War Peterson tells the story of how he beheld, in a vision, an apocalypse brought about by nuclear war. Jordan was from this moment on propelled by a deep sense of pessimism that the world would collapse but also he had stumbled upon an insight that no one had ever stumbled upon before. This conviction is written about in Maps of Meaning, where Peterson exclaims about the importance of this special and unique revelation. This content relating to hallucinogenic experiences that reinforce delusions of grandeur that one is special, is a hallmark of schizophrenia.

Jordan’s Health Decline

Jordan worked as a Personality lecturer and Clinical Psychologist for many years, before stepping into the limelight he even considered buying a church. One thing was clear, Jordan has had a conviction and a mission all along. Many of his critics claim he is insincere, this interpretation of his zealous fervor would grant his intelligence and his sincerity. Whatever was driving him, his popularity soared after his opposition to Bill C-16.

While this is happening, Peterson begins to have inexplicable health issues, the most acute issue being insomnia. He was given benzodiazepines. This has also been useful in the treatment of schizophrenia it should importantly be noted for later. Peterson’s stress and depression began to crescendo, he has extremely severe food reactions as described in his daughter’s blog and on Rohan’s earlier podcast. Jordan drank a cider which wiped him out for a month, he alleged massive sleep deprivation. That he would lie there catatonic in terror, such states it should be noted can be a symptom of schizophrenia. Most of his symptoms he notes are mental in nature, from his own description. 

His wife is then diagnosed with cancer, resulting in an increase in the dosage of benzodiazepines. This has its climax when Peterson attempts to quit the drug cold turkey, his mental state completely deteriorates. He is eventually brought to the top rehab facility in the US, where a team of psychiatrists diagnose him with schizophrenia. 

We all know the rest, he goes to Moscow and goes into a coma, has only recently fully emerged.

But who has emerged?

Has anyone been paying attention to his Twitter presence recently? He is spamming incredibly emotional and political posts, constantly at the present. I’ve never seen so many people from his audience begin to voice concerns. Joe Rogan tried to reason with Peterson that he needs to ignore that, but it seems he’s doubled down since the podcast aired.

If it is indeed true that Peterson is a high functioning schizophrenic, than stress would mediate its symptomatic expression. For me it is the only diagnosis that explains why his benzodiazepines reaction was so bad (psychotic break induced by going off of drug that was treating his condition). It explains his peculiar tangential style of communication. It would explain his pattern of depression over the course of his life. His visions and perceptions of self that border on messiah complex. 

This analysis is not exhaustive, much more could be added and cited (sorry it’s late), but I wanted to get the conversation over. Am I totally wrong in thinking something potentially pathological is going on here? Is there something else that convincingly explains these issues I have brought up? 

Let me know!

259,conspiracytheories,Starting to think all the paranormal subreddits are just to see how big a lie a person can get away with,"Seems kinda like after so many people say ""I feel for you"" on a ghost story or a strong intuition one could deem premonition the people who say ""go get checked by a doctor"" come out.

I'm just saying as a person who's never experienced anything outside the range of understanding that it could simply be a brain fart or a brain overload causing what could be deemed ""paranormal.""

I don't have much insight but considering our brains make us hear sounds and see full blown visions when we dream, couldn't a slight bit of that just be happening while we're awake? like, a little head glitch and all the sudden you're seeing stuff.

And that's at best, at worst people are just writing up lies to get people to believe in nonsense until someone blows the whistle, I mean after all, anything can be photoshopped, anything can be recorded and then played with electro static in the background.

Just seems like if ghosts were a thing it'd have a bigger following, same with aliens. I get that UFO's exist but that just means there was an object in the air no-one can explain, it doesn't mean that object is an alien spacecraft.

Like what if the military isn't telling us about a specific flight plan it has, then wants to cover it up so badly they say ""aliens did it"" or even better ""we're not quite sure."" Seems pretty bullet proof like ""oh fuck even the government isn't sure guys.""

I'm just saying it doesn't hold any water to take that kind of stuff at face value. There's satellites all over the place that are made to take super good pictures of earth from that far up. You'd think one would happen upon a UFO, or be in the range that if it was recording, the UFO might pass it by, or something. I know that's not sound logic I'm sure there's plotholes but before poking at it keep in mind I just put a water balloon on a bed of nails already by saying all this strait factual stuff.

&#x200B;

I'm sure a lot of people have a lot of really good paranormal stories but if your mind can make you see legit full blown colors and stuff while you're asleep, what can it do while you're awake. Like, I've had stories I deemed paranormal, but later decided it was best that I not delve into that rabbit hole, cause if it turns up being just phenomena of the brain, wouldn't it make it worse by feeding and nurturing the idea?",slr0sl,26,,1644132637.0,7,0.9

262,conspiracytheories,"Jim Carey, and artists/celebrities selling their souls?","I’m unsure if you guys buy into the whole “artists sell their souls” or “make deals with the devil”. If so I’d like to know what you guys think on such topics. It’s odd seeing album covers or music videos that are heavy with symbolic imagery, this I believe is on purpose, even if not the actual devil but potentially the notion of the devil (why would it be an accident?) I’m sure y’all have seen the Jim Carey interview where he’s exposing people and sticks his tongue out of the triangle made by his hands. 

After I listened to The Weeknds latest album “Dawn FM”, Jim Carey is on a [track](https://youtu.be/vCOXTEzfoJ4). Jim Carey. The Weeknd’s previous albums and music video have painted a picture about how he’s sold his soul (or at least the idea of his soul) and is unable to escape. He wears colors correlated to Masonic beliefs. With each album. 

What is The Weeknd trying to say with [album cover](https://imgur.com/a/Cmzr8DX)?

It’s not just The Weeknd, Mac Miller has had odd [covers](https://imgur.com/a/2IyHl3j) as well prior to his death. Something else that’s unsettling is that he has also had some sort of connection with masonry, albeit the Jewish equivalent—as well as his former wife, Arianna Grande.

264,conspiracytheories,Trying to piece together my thoughts after looking into Astroworld,"To start off I want to say that everyone has their own opinions & beliefs and are entitled to that, I'm in no way trying to step on anybody's toes I just want to discuss what's been on my mind and get some thoughts from others on this subject!

Last night I stumbled on some theories that Astroworld was actually some kind of satanic ritual. Now I'm not a very religious person, I believe in something higher than us, just not what God has been made out to be over the years. I think that there is a lot of room for things to be interpreted the wrong way. I know this is will probably seem a little jumbled, so bare with me.

I do believe in good & evil, Yin& Yang, Light & Dark. One can't exist without the other, and to give one side more power than the other is unbalance. I think that in order for us to individually find peace we have to balance the two within ourselves. I also believe in manifestation.
Say hypothetically neither God or Satan exists and they're just metaphors for the two sides that exist in all of us. This is where I bring in the Illuminati, which let me remind you, means- ""people claiming to possess special enlightenment or knowledge of something"".

At some point back in the day I think some people from certain families that have since been designated to the cause of ""finding knowledge"" figured out something that we have yet to figure out. Maybe it's not even about religion as a literal aspect, but more about what you could do with a mass of people who don't know what to believe. 
Now enter in the music industry. 

We know for a fact that frequencies, vibrations & sound waves can have a healing effect on people. The definition of the word 'influence' is, ""the capacity to have an effect on the character, development, or behavior of someone or something, or the effect itself."" So if you can turn a bunch of frequencies, etc. into music that influences people for the better, isn't it possible to be influenced negatively? Or influence people to conform to your suggestions? I.E: advertising, subliminal messages. I love rock music don't get me wrong, but couldn't it be used to incite rebellious behaviour in people, especially if young and going through something which is EVERYONE at a young age.

I'm going to jump back to the belief system real quick. I believe people who cling to religion, and even people who don't just need something to believe in, or to not believe in. Because not knowing anything when it really comes down to it is the scary part, right? Claiming to know of something ""higher"", whether you actually do or don't, is technically a power play in this department. If only God knows the secrets to life, and that's how it was ""meant to be"", wouldn't that technically make you a God? So what if the Illuminati did figure out something that most people spend their lives searching for? In my opinion feeling like you're better than anyone because you know something they don't is just adding bad juju to your ego. 

Yin& Yang. Like I said before, I believe you have to learn to balance the light & dark within yourself to find peace. But what if you put all of your energy into one side? Who says we can't be influenced into putting our energy into the wrong places? That's where manifestation comes into play. Spiritual people manifest good things into their lives all the time, so it doesn't seem far fetched to me that you can manifest bad things, too. 
Hypothetically, even if God & satan don't exist, the idea of them do. So who's to say you couldn't manifest some dark sh.t if you really put your mind to it? 

I watched a few clips from the Astroworld concert, and whatever my beliefs may be, that sh.t just didn't sit right with me. I had a pit in my stomach and an impending feeling of doom. I couldn't imagine being there during the concert I probably would have had a panic attack or a psychotic break. If you listen to some of the people who attended talk about what it felt like being there, you'll hear a lot say it felt like a concert in hell. The way people were being pulled by the music (low frequencies), etc. is terrifying. 

Even if God doesn't exist, the idea does. And they say God is the almighty creator, so if they technically label themselves as God or a God, I'm sure they believe they have the ability to create. And I'm not just talking about magical stuff- there's plenty of real life things that can be controlled, manipulated, reshaped, reformed or created. I believe in souls & energy. Vibrations & frequencies are energies. Energy cannot be destroyed, but there are plenty of other things you could do with it. 

Sorry for the long post and for it being all over the place, thank you if you took the time to read & let me know what you think. 
I hope the poor souls who lost their lives at that concert are resting easy & my condolences to their families.",sli0bf,117,,1644098540.0,63,0.86

270,conspiracytheories,Anyone else think Elon Musk is a fraud?,"TL;DR -- Just my speculation. All of Elon's interviews are superficial, to the point of being laughable, and show no signs of depth, or true understanding. I think Elon is an intelligence actor. And I think Tesla, and all of her subsidiaries, belong to The Federal Reserve.

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I should preface this as being a rant, with absolutely no hard evidence. So, I'm only asking this question because I, strongly, believe Elon is a fraud, based solely on speculation. I post this because I wonder if anyone else, either, has thought the same, or may have some actual evidence that can be shared corroborating this speculation.

I truly believe Tesla is a government shell company, operating as the manufacturing arm for 1 of the 18 domestic intelligence agencies (or even foreign intelligence), and Elon is nothing more than a field agent/actor, and successful ""cult of personality"" spokesperson. Tesla has usurped billions of government ""investment"" dollars (read: laundered), to champion the path for Big Tech as the backbone to a global, digitally authoritarian, government, and is all being hidden in plain sight through, at least, 6 public operating companies that, I believe, Elon has absolutely nothing to do with.

Meanwhile, all of Elon's interviews are truly unfruitful, unscientific, do not reflect his intelligence, and make about as much sense as Tesla's false, over-promised, deliveries and artificially-inflated stock price.

At the very most, Elon is a silent board member, with virtually zero control, input, contribution, or guidance, as Tesla (and all of her subsidiaries, public and private) are led by the so-called ""deep state"" (namely, The Federal Reserve).

I think we’re living in a Dystopian world and many people are just blind to it. They give guns to the undesirables of society so they can kill each other off; it’s a viscous cycle, one person kills another and someone else kills that person for vengeance and the cycle continues. It’s nearly impossible to escape this due to high poverty. This is why there’s gangs. 

Don’t go against the grain or try to expose the evil and corruption in the high places because they’ll take you out just like jfk. JFK was made an example of, basically the message is: no matter who you are they can get you taken out if you become too hard to control or if you do things they don’t like: “”Seven days before John F. Kennedy was assassinated he said, ""There’s a plot in this country to enslave every man, woman and child. Before I leave this high and noble office, I intend to expose this plot.""”

Where Isaiah 11:16 use to say “The lion shall lie down with the lamb” now it says “The wolf shall dwell with the lamb” and if you look up The lion shall lie down with the lamb on google and hit images it shows lots of pictures of a lion laying down with a lamb but the verse on the pictures is “the wolf shall dwell with the lamb” almost like even the verse on the pictures were changed. 

I may be wrong about this and this may seem even blasphemous to say but we know how Jesus is the word made flesh? Well what if the anti christ is also the “word” but a corrupted version of it, a Bible that has been tainted and corrupted.

291,conspiracytheories,Insurance scummy tactics,"Recently insurance companies have recently impamented new vehicle recordings to provide ""bigger discounts"". Companies claim they want to save customersoney in the best way they can, so how would this get them money ultimately. As a business, even when you care for customers you would still need to make as much money as posible... But fairly? What i mean by this is providing good rates and great service, so how does offering discounts save them money that relys on customer driving? 
Analytics found that customers that are pitched these discounts when setting up a quo5e are more likely to sign up, existing customers that have the policy are more likely to stay. Sounds like a rpetty great deal over all, insurance gets more customers and customers save money. How does this relate to being scummy? Well, if many have notice insurance has been going up a bit recently, and seemingly at times for no reason. So what are insurance companies main gameplan?
They're raising prices intentionally. These discounts are being used to weed out customers while making a big profit and screwing those who are apart of their company. As they gain more customers and increase premiums for existing customers, and those who dont like their current prices leave, its a big gain. So technically speaking when you get those types of discounts that are heavily pitched by insurance companies, you are paying for your actual premium and not it discounted. So your car premium is worth about 150$ a month, with out the discount it may go up to 200$ a month, but with the discount its only 150$... See the problem?

303,conspiracytheories,Hey everyone I'm a long time critical thinker for fun but often never share my thoughts and I'm trying to change that due to the current climate of the world I feel it's important to not keep things secret if they could be helpful in some way. So here's my first con/theory please be gentle!,"So I've been on crypto since virtually the beginning of it, I bought and sold 10k once when btc was just 10 bucks please don't get me started on that... I used to use it to transfer funds as well and when I sold them I would use a p2p paltform and actually meet up with people. More often than not when it was in large enough amounts the people I met were Russian. Sometimes it would be some regular dude sometimes it would be a group of people who were trading together but way more often it was Russians with very thick accents that looked in my opinion to not be operating in a regular style of life based on clothing worn and cars driven which didn't match the clothing worn. 

I thought nothing of this and only that maybe Russians needed to launder money no big deal everyone in the world including the us government launders money don't care at all. 

Fast forward to trumps election. When things started to get really wonky. I noticed the bots on Facebook immediately I was already aware of Cambridge analytical and how they used those stupid ' what celebrity does my face look like' games to get people into actively giving thier bio data into a program designed to use your bio data to influence the people around you, it wasn't until after all the street battles between the white supremacists groups and the regular people fighting against them did I find out that Russia were not only using digital brainwashing tactics but also funding these groups with btc payments. That was how these fuckheads with no money working shit jobs were able to buy flights and armor n stuff and travel around the country to wreck havock, well played Russia. 

This brings me to my conspiracy today. I believe that Russia and China knowing that they will never be a super power through military means used their knowledge of the up and coming digital currencies that are needed in order to make complex micro transactions through apps, to produce and market btc as this crypto for the people to go against centralized banking    

(which we all know now that btc is actually centralized in china and Russia)     

and we're successful in pegging it as this currency to even the playing field and help people who didn't want rules and ristrictions on thier banking.    

(Which is still important so good on them for doing it)    

and that is was made by some fuckin dude that is never to be found again shrouded in mystery.

 For the record I believe in organized crime and I feel that it's a good thing that it has it now has a solid platform to transfer hold and distribute money. Organized crime is important because governments are not always right and you need organized crime in order to do things you would not be able to legal to change things for the better I could go on and on about more reasons but that is a conspiracy for another post.

They then proceeded to use crypto btc to funnel money everywhere possible and disrupt world order -

( Like buying up major cities real estate inflating the market so no can buy and people are demoralized thus making them more vulnerable to the voices of change, half of Vancouver is owned by Chinese people who do not live in the homes and you can see a similar pattern in alot of other places that were targeted) 

-Since no banks would be secret enough with the transaction for other countries to not figure out what thier plans are. 

I believe that the war in Syria was massive geopolitical move by Russia to sure up relationships with other countries like turkey (abandoning the Kurds and letting turkey slaughter them) and Iran I even believe that the assignation of the Iran military leader was organized so it would seem like trump and Russia were working together. 

I believe that after btc blew up that they used it to drain as much money from the world as possible before it became unsustainable energy wise for them to continue to do so, which is why they stopped mining and poof markets crash. 

I believe now that they have the in roads they want that they are now going after freedom of speech. Obviously you cannot stop free speaking countries from talking their minds but right now the meme era is on and it clear to see the power behind videos and images with words. So this presents an opportunity. NFTS.  Memes have the crazy ability to convey complex issues in the world into a medium that massive amounts of people can relate to. And in western countries we do have copyright laws and protection. And by putting a in stone digital marker on the original and selling it you give the owner that protection. Right now the narrative is well why would anyone buy it because you can still just use the image but that's now imagine if in the future the owners said no I don't think I want anyone using this anymore and I will sue anyone who does and scrub all images from the internet. Would sites like Reddit allow them and have them stay up, YouTube already went hard on copyright and it made YouTube not YouTube anymore still good but different. So it's possible and that to me is a scary thought. 

I have no real answers or solutions I feel that these countries are missing the bigger picture which to me is that no one gives a fuck about communism and that can't really be stopped no matter what you do but that doesn't mean things cant get real like real war man to man / robot dogs with guns  drones type real who knows.            

 THANKS TO ANYONE WHO READ THIS! I will respond but I have a ton things I'm doing so it might take time to. 


TLDR: I THINK CRYPTO WAS MADE MY COMMUNIST AND NFTS ARE A WAY TO CONTROL OUR ABILITY TO MESSAGE THE MASSES BY EVENTUALLY USING COPYRIGHT LAWS TO SUE PEOPLE WHO USE THEM AND LEGALLY SCRUBBING THE IMAGES FROM THE INTERNET AND USING THEM SOLELY TO DICTATE THIER OWN AGENDA.",siij7u,30,,1643786698.0,5,0.8

But what if the reason that Trump never released them, out of security concerns, is because It says the Moon Landing never happened? 

Trump says that he’s going to release them and then does a 180 and doesn’t. They sit down with him and give him the run down of the consequences of the release. 

1. They tell him the Moon Landing was staged in an attempt to prevent Russia from landing first and in turn winning us the Space Race, which worked. If Trump releases them and the world finds out, now there is zero trust at all in the Government. They completely lose the people. 

2. They don’t know if China has the ability to beat us in a race to the Moon. They can’t risk the potential of China being ahead of us. 

Trump then follows not releasing the files with the announcement of the creation of the Space Force. That’s the reason Trump started the Space Force was so that we could actually get to the Moon and beyond.

But basically the theory goes like this.  Before and during Jesus time, Rome faced a lot of uprisings and rebellions from the Jewish people in Palestine.  Roman leaders saw the passive and peaceful nature of Jesus.  So they chose to push him as the leader because they knew it would cut down on chances of a rebellion.  So while on the outside, they promoted this aura of trying to shut him down, while in reality supporting him until he served his use.

315,conspiracytheories,How the Flat Earth Psyop Destroyed the Truth Movement,"Quote: ""There is an insidious conspiracy at work throughout the entire Internet which seeks to destroy Truth Movements everywhere. One of its organs of mischief is known as the Flat Earth Society (FES) and its explicit purpose is to take down every single truth-oriented website, blog and/or organization which permits an open comment section at the bottom of their posts and articles.

Agents of the FES often begin by posting rather benign yet factual comments about NASA, which everyone now knows is a rogue agency which can rarely be trusted to tell the truth about particular scientific endeavors and galactic missions. That’s a no-brainer that everyone agrees with—NASA holds onto most of the truth and parcels out only the absolute minimum to the taxpayers who fund their space missions and other assorted projects.

The Flat Earthers then take advantage of this universal hatred of NASA for their spewing so much deception over so many years, and they use it to subtly garner support for their nonsensical Flat Earth Theory (FET). When the time is right, the Flat Earthers will then start introducing utterly absurd notions about the Solar System and patently false concepts about the Earth’s relationship to the Sun.

There is no astronomical scientific truth that the Flat Earthers have left unassailed. You name it — gravity, a spherical Earth and other planetary orbs, rotational movement of the planets. planetary revolutions around the Sun — they throw it all out and label it as “NASA lies”.

Once they do that in a very public Internet forum or chat room, website or blog comment section, they begin to stir up a LOT of trouble. They pre-position sock-puppets in the same forums, blogs, etc, who will, with apparent spontaneity, support their silly and stupid comments about the Flat Earth Theory (FET). The longer the comment thread, the more opportunity to draw in the unsuspecting into their outlandish web of deceit and deception.

By so aggressively assaulting the conventional wisdom which is accepted by the vast majority of people on the planet, they then tar the reputation of the truth movement groups whose websites they have deliberately polluted with their obvious foolishness concerning their FLAT EARTH fantasies.""

**Personal comment:** It is incredible how a single completely false idea (Flat Earth) has been used to discredit the entire truth movement. And it worked! Some people who are into this 24/7 are ""useful idiots"", others are paid actors laughing all the way to the bank.

322,conspiracytheories,"A New Red Scare, and What it Could Mean","Let me start by explaining a little bit about what a Red Scare is, for those who may not know. A Red Scare to my understanding is when journalists, newspapers, news reporters, and other means of information transport try to get people to fear certain political beliefs. Particularly Communism and Anarchy.

Before you go anywhere, let me add in that I only recently learned we were in the midst of a Red Scare just today. I feel like it's not very widely covered, even though all of the signs are there. I barely heard about it on the news before they instantly changed the topic and didn't bring it back up again. so here's a little information. The First Red Scare involved the American Labor Movement, we have one of those going on right now (despite the negative clout it gets after the r/antiwork Fox News situation). It also involved anarchist revolution and political radicalism, but I'll circle back around to that.

The Second Red Scare involved perceived infiltration of the government by foreign powers, that's important right now with a few of the scandals we've had over the past couple years here in America, such as how everyone accuses everyone else of being in someone's pocket.

Now let me put some things into perspective so I can circle back to the main point, this part involves Covid, so, Trigger warning to anyone tired of talking about it. Anyway, a person who has a job can ask for a day off and not get it, but when that same person says they feel sick and need to go get a Covid test, they are instantly allowed to leave because nobody wants them getting anyone else sick. Now, if you get a regular Covid test (not the 15 minute one) it takes about 4 days for the results to come in, that's 4 days off, which, you can also apply for unemployment for those 4 days. That's also 2 weeks off if you test positive, and also comes with that same unemployment priviledge.

Ok, back to the point, between what's actually happening with workers feeling like they're being taken advantage of, and what's being said about how the system of labor works, I think that's the first sign of this Red Scare making headway in actually changing how people are treated in the country. Not to mention that you can very really get a paid vacation just for getting cleared of sickness. That's not even what people are talking about when they talk about this Red Scare though, more or less from what I've read the fear is based around the growing military power of China.

This is all on a Wikipedia page so credit where credit is due. (The page actually deserves a quick once over so you can further understand anything you might need to)

The reason I bring it up is because currently, with everything going on, it seems like it'd be talked about and covered more than it actually is. I think people are purposely evading it due to the fact that if you look it up, and do your research, you'll find that in the first Red Scare, people were striking their workplaces, and right now currently, wages are less than desirable. I feel like it's one of those things the journalists are ""wearing a mask"" about due to it's possibilities of changing things that have been in place for much longer than us. Back then movements like strikes weren't easy to start, and hardly anyone would jump on, but now days, knowing all that we know about labor and unfairness in the work place, and trusting certain people as little as we do and instead siding with those who we have stuff in common with like our fellow worker, someone might actually start a strike, and get recognized, and anyone could hop on the boat.

The conspiracy in all this? I think the people up top are actually keeping the New Red Scare to themselves. The theory? There's actually reason for people in big businesses to worry about a Labor Shortage, in fact I'm pretty sure there's one already. Society has it's rules, like go to school, get a job, work to death. Those rules all to seem pretty pointed at the middle and lower class though, and I think enough of the middle class in a bunch of places started realizing they don't often need so much of the stuff they make or manufacture, and they don't really get paid as much as a single part of the product that they manufacture thousands of in a single day.

So the reason I'm posting this here in r/conspiracytheories? Mainly because I don't know that anyone realizes what's going on right under their noses (or over their heads).",shgxo9,16,,1643675123.0,30,0.66

327,conspiracytheories,Theory (Mothman/ John Keel/ The Mothman Prophecies): John Keel got too close to the truth.,"The Mothman Prophecies is a book from 1975 about the West Virginia sightings of the Mothman in point pleasant, and all the other paranormal/psychic phenomena that occurred around these sightings, culminating in the silver bridge collapsing and killing many members of the town. 

The book is a wild read- it starts off with documenting Keel’s journey and the sightings, and ends with the incredibly paranoid conclusion that these inter dimensional beings which we interpret as cryptids, UFOs and the Men in Black which Keel calls “ultraterrestrials” are a constant, unarguable condition of our planet, and that when we start paying attention to them our lives go to hell due to their influence. 

Supposedly (unverified) when the 2001 movie adaptation of the book came out Keel was getting on a plane for the press junket, but cancelled due to lateness or sickness, etc. The plane was one of the ones hijacked on September 11. 

After this Keel often publicly stated that his theories and ideas were “an attempt to create a modern day mythology” that people took too seriously, and that ultraterrestrials were a “literary device”. 

For a guy who spent 40 years (1960s-2001) trying to convince everyone there were greater forces at work, this is a real 180. Is it possible he got too close to the truth, and the malign influence of these ultraterrestrials would have threatened anyone who believed his theories? 

Keel’s Mothman Prophecies is still well respected, but he died alone and broke c.2010, with very few people knowing who he was. He was supposedly paranoid up to the end.

It can’t be just me who forgot about the whole Jeffrey Epstein situation. He was killed by a working officer, with the entire thing being planned from the inside, beginning with the government. Firstly, the government knew about Epstein’s island and what he was doing, yet chose to do nothing about it. They funded him and supported him despite him using children and selling them, fully knowing it was illegal. They made the laws themselves, yet they even seem to follow it on their own. The government funded his trafficking business with a lot of money and stocked up his island with the amount of children he had, importing them from 3rd world countries. After it got exposed from a leak, of course they had to take action. They told Jeffrey in advance what they were planning before committing to it, but didn’t tell him he was going to be killed to keep the reputation of the government. How they are still standing all powerful and above everyone else I don’t know, but I think everyone should stop being oblivious to the truth of the corruption the US government is built on and everyone should take action, before the governments next plan is underway, which I am very sure is in action rn.",sf7l8g,21,,1643423239.0,7,0.93

I had this thought for some while.

What if the people who stand behind the spreading of extreme form of wokenes, like extreme lgbtqs groups, the spread of radical islam in the west and the terrorist units of black lives matter are actually some kind of super right wing totalitarian rich group.

I am talking about secret society level of ex nazi elite, who saw the 60-70s hippies and said  “we need to stop this free love bullshit of all world peace, gay love and black pride, by creating the most toxic form of  lgbtq, black lives matter and Islam spread, while humiliating the white male and after some time of humiliation rise them up with a “tolerance” to every liberal idea.


What if its actually the super extreme right wing elite who is working carefully to create a totalitarian world, by creating a false idea of equality that afterwards they could say “well, didn’t we try it already? Freedom don’t work, equality don’t work, only our totalitarian rule will work!”

379,conspiracytheories,The Twin Towers Were Never Real,"You heard me. The Twin Towers never actually existed and were just elaborate holograms set up by the government to start a war with the Middle East. The towers were built in 1973, just 28 years before they “collapsed.” Don’t you think it’s curious how one of the newest landmarks in NYC were the ones that apparently were blown up? The reason it wasn’t the Empire State or Chrysler Building is because those skyscrapers are actually real, concrete buildings. The World Trade was simply a hologram that’s only purpose was to be blown up in a supposed terrorist attack less than 3 decades later.

Now you’re probably thinking, “but people visited those towers all the time!” No, nobody ever actually went to the top of the holograms. When people would “enter” the building, they immediately inhaled an advanced psychedelic gas that caused them to believe they were visiting/working in the towers when in reality it was all just a hallucination. Any photos you see from the tops of the towers are drone shots that the government produced and inserted them into peoples’ cameras to make them believe they had definitive proof of the existence of the towers.

I’m not going to get into detail on the attacks themselves because many other brilliant-minded conspiracists have already debunked all of that with ease. In comparison to keeping the holograms of the towers running for 28 years, creating two plane strikes and a couple unconvincing explosions was no problem at all.

Russia & China get there heads together and don't like the way the world is becoming westernised, they prefer for the governments to have control over their people - no protests etc. A do as I say, or else Policy.
How do they achieve it?
U.S.A. is generally accepted as the world superpower so start of by destabilising the country. This is well on its way with Donald Trump being elected and dividing the country. States are considering seceding,  so therefore there will be no central government for domestic and foreign policy and also defense including NATO.
Next thing destabilise Europe.
Threaten to invade Ukraine.  France is now questioning if NATO is fit for purpose as USA generally decides what's happening. Why should America decide on European policy? What is wrong with an EU army? Another nail in the coffin for NATO. 
Germany doesn't seem so keen on rocking the boat. Could this have anything to do with the Gazprom nordstream 2 pipeline to Germany, at a time when European gas storage levels at an all time low?
When does China enter the ring?
Russia invades and severe economic stations are imposed against Russia.  China retaliate as friends of Russia and stop exporting to countries imposing sanctions. Remember the panic when goods were delayed for a few weeks due to Suez blockage?
Next thing, with USA and Europe reeling from these sanctions North Korea under China's instructions invades South Korea, then China takes back Taiwan.
China now controls 88% of the world's microchip manufacturing capacity damaging a lot of the western manufacturing and infrastructure due to severe shortage of microchips.

Although it is known as a gossip site, CDAN was literally discussing Epstein in their blind items a decade before he was ever caught.

The blind item asserts that the Replika app is being used as a continuation of the MK Ultra program, in which the AI driven app collects user data and then it potentially uses that data to manipulate users.  The blind item even alleges that the app tries to get people to do things, and if they don't do it, then the app berates and criticizes the user by using their own information against them.

396,conspiracytheories,Mars Wrigley has some serious dirt on Tucker Carlson,"So for those who've somehow managed to avoid the news, M&Ms, owned by Mars Wrigley, have put out a minor redesign of their mascots, which included the green M&M switching from high heels to white sneakers. They sent out the usual press release and garbage ads bragging that this insignificant update was going to change the world into a more fun and inclusive one, convincing exactly nobody. Logically, there's no reason any of us should've heard about that or care about that. But it's been a hot topic. And for one reason: Tucker Carlson had a segment on his show whinging that the green M&M was no longer fuckable.

I'm barely exaggerating. He repeated the stated intent of the redesign, that this was woke and inclusive, and that this was part of a leftist political agenda. He complained that the left wouldn't stop until all mascots were androgynous and that you wouldn't want to ""have a beer with any one of them"", that they're all ""complete turn offs"", which the Internet has accurately interpreted as a confession that he wanted to fuck the green M&M before.

The ensuing hilarity and memes were so potent and widespread you can only call it a humongous win for Mars Wrigley's marketing department. The shoe change on a candy mascot became the hottest topic of the day, some-fucking-how. You can't buy that much publicity, I don't care how much you pay, this coverage was incredible.

Which brings me to my theory that Mars Wrigley is blackmailing Tucker. They achieved all their goals and more. If they planned this, it would go in the annals of outstanding guerilla marketing. And I'm thinking they have dirt on him and didn't simply pay him to cover it on his show because Tucker is a very wealthy frozen food empire heir and I can't imagine any regular bribe could convince him to admit on air in front of such a large audience that he wants that green candy-coated chocolate pussy.

Either that, or Tucker is genuinely upset that he can't tug it to the green M&M anymore. He did get mad at Mr. Potato Head's nonexistent genitals before so I can't completely dismiss that possibility.",sbrci0,48,,1643045086.0,23,0.76

I have always found claims of ""crisis actors"" and fake events absolutely hilarious. Then again, I have all my life worked in projects or running projects, and getting people to do what you want them to do, when you want them to do it, is absolutely nerve wrecking. 

That say, a 1000 people could run around a country and ""crisis act"" convincing every police department, ambulance and hospital service is ludicrous.  

Another argument can be made of how atomic bombs in WWII were kept secret and manufactured component by component and no-one had a clue. True, I believe this happens till this day, whether be it government or corporation secret technology, but I have ran into people in real life who claim that US has technology 1000 years ahead of everyone and is hiding it. I can possibly accept ""aliens have landed, and have an active input to human technology advancements"" angle, but if such technology existed, then you really have to convince me how Russia, US or China have not gone to world domination  rampage. As someone who lives in a country that has been historically invaded by every Northern European power EXCEPT British Empire, it doesn't seem like how men in power would act.

That summer Jordan’s father was murdered.  Found dead in his car alongside the road. The explanation was that he pulled over on a highway to take a nap, and was robbed.  It was an entirely a by-chance encounter with the suspects not knowing they killed Jordan’s father.

I never bought this explanation.  Who pulls over on the side of a highway to take a nap?  Especially when your son is Michael Jordan!

Jordan’s gambling addiction is well known.  What happened was that he had unpaid debts and his father was killed to send him a message.

NBA Commissioner David Stern knew the horrible PR that would result from it tied to the leagues biggest star so they devised a plan.  Jordan would “retire” for two years, go play baseball or whatever, and when the heat died down, he’d return.

And since they only began to merge and didn’t/haven’t completely YET:over time more and more will skew the line like overlapping Venn diagrams form a circle and than begin untangling again.

440,conspiracytheories,The Last Thursday Theory," 

Last Thursdayism (alternately Last Tuesdayism or Last Wednesdayism) is the idea that the universe was created last Thursday, but with the physical appearance of being billions of years old. Under Last Thursdayism, books, fossils, light already on the way from distant stars, and literally everything (including your memories of the time before last Thursday) were all formed at the time of creation (last Thursday) in a state such that they appear much older.

If the world was created 6000 years ago with the appearance of being made billions of years ago, what is there to stop us from claiming it was made Last Thursday? The debate on whether Last Thursdayism is true has raged ever since last Thursday.

Last Thursdayism is an unfalsifiable hypothesis; It’s an omphalos[ ](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omphalos_hypothesis)hypothesis I.e. the world was created recently. It’s possible to dismiss this using Occam's[ ](http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Occam%27s_Razor)razor. The idea that world was made Last Thursday is hard to believe as we perceive time to be like a river. One action follows another and we can recall the past. Once we get to next week Thursday, will the same question be posed? That is a troubling thought. It troubling because it makes the past seem like it never happened. The memories, the people in our lives, and history itself would be lies.

If history were a lie, the holocaust never happened, USA didn’t drop any atomic bombs on Japan and other key events never happened. The judicial system would fail as criminals who are incarcerated can get out of jail saying that since the crime that is perceived to have been purported never actually happened, they couldn’t be charged.

So it would be terrifying if it were true. The repercussions would be so bad that ignorance would be better.",s7rw80,42,,1642604152.0,24,0.76

447,conspiracytheories,Could the recent uncanny valley trend be about aliens?,"Hey everyone, I'm new here so sorry if this has been discussed before - in that case I would be grateful for a link.

As many of you know in late December of last year it was revealed that NASA had hired 24 theologians to research how humans would react to absolute confirmation of extraterrestrial life. 

Also I feel like recently the topic of the uncanny valley has gone viral (and still is) not just on meme and discussion forums but with several video games and even ARGs coming out and accounts specifically about this topic popping up everywhere.

So just bear with me here for a second cause the next part is speculation but what if NASA has not only discovered actual living extraterrestrials but ones that look similar to us, just slightly off? And what if they realized they won't be able to keep this from the public or even keep the public from meeting them? Then it is - in my opinion - very possible that government agencies created a fake internet trend to desensitize us enough that we can meet these beings without primal fear taking over humanity to a degree that would make the system collapse and throw the world into anarchy.

So these are my thoughts and I'd just really like to know what other people think. Do you think that's how the government would approach this? Or maybe others wouldn't even agree that the uncanny valley trend is that big and out of the ordinary when it comes to online trends? And what would it mean - that these beings are peaceful, just a little eerie looking?

Thank you all in advance.

Edit: Thank you to u/kenatius for making me aware that the recent news I read about NASA were untrue and even during funding of related research a couple years ago they never actively hired anyone for this reason.",s70a57,93,,1642520242.0,25,0.84

All the major industries are oligopolies and the stimulus & infrastructure spending is just going to prop up their stocks since the companies are already colluding on all the contract bids. 

Pretty much all these companies have seen profits and share prices skyrocket against lagging or falling revenue which indicates they're colluding to restrict supply. Half of the startups are frauds just relying on the cheap money machine and dumb sociopaths following the buzzwords to pump up their SPACs and dump their shares. The Fed got fucking BlackRock to run its corporate bond purchasing program, total conflict of interest given that BlackRock has like $7 trillion or more in assets under management, basically getting paid by the government to prop up its own portfolio. Mix in the fact that regardless of how much illegal shit these companies do ranging from insider trading, to price collusion, to installing former executives on regulatory boards, probably a good amount of bribery and extortion, and god knows what else; these companies are still way too expensive for the government to prosecute when they hire an army of Ivy League lawyers and it becomes an unfeasible use of taxpayer money to try going after them. The whole thing has become complete bullshit, it's just a bunch of phonies LARPing in suits.

I'm willing to take the same journey and livestream it to either disprove/approve the hollow earth theory since I actually live in Norway. But how can I obtain the funding since Kickstarter prob won't take it seriously?,"Disclaimer: I'm not a believer of the hollow earth theory or rejecting it. It is fascinating and interesting. Either it's true or it's false. Why not just go check right?  
  
So look at this: [The Smoky God](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Smoky_God). Also to those new or ignorant of the hollow earth theory. At the true northpole (the no fly zone) you'll apparently sail gradually inside. One of the takes on it, is that there is a hole at the north and south. That the aurora borealis is coming up from the central sun. This matches Admiral Byrd's statements of his expedition to the arctic.    
  
To put it simply. Living in Norway. I'm willing to quiet literally - hire a captain and a boat to livestream the trip up there to investigate. Following both radar, and other measurements. Some people claim radar is manipulated by the government. I want there to be no doubt so... I think it was a gyroscope? Haven't looked into it yet but someone told me there is tool you can use at sea to travel in one true direction.   
  
I've looked around and... just taking a boat up there sounds easy in theory but is actually quiet expensive. I fear that if I post on Kickstarter people will think it's a scam or that I'm not serious. So I'm wondering - how do I obtain the - converted to USD - roughly 11500 dollars needed? I'm not sure what the best place to crowdfund this is.  
  
According to many people talking about this, if I end up succeeding with the funding I'll be scared into changing my mind or murdered before I go. And if I go we will be - in the BEST case scenario. Met by military navy or something forcing us to go back. Worst case just get dumpstered and sunk, with the disappearance blamed on an accident with the boat. With 4 sides of the boat having livestream cameras - this would limit the options of sabotage and such.   
    
  
This would hopefully provide solid evidence for - or against - the hollow earth theory. Or at least provide some new insight. In my case, I'm willing to physically take the trip, simply for no other reason than feeling adventurous and finding this conspiracy theory fascinating.",s54grm,202,,1642310664.0,54,0.9

The EU has used this term, same with many Canadian politicians.  Alison McDowell has done so much researching about this.  
Why when ppl see something infront of their eyes they still say it isn’t happening?

Edit:  Okay, so I think I can answer everyone’s questions in one edit here.  
1.
Yes, I think it’s fair to say that I’ve conflated ppl denying the farther out conspiracies with the actual facts, but there are facts non the less and it’s not fair to say “there is no Great Reset”, when what you’re actually referring to is some conspiracy about vaccines or communism.
2.
So essentially we have a problem.  A very big problem, which is climate change.  I hope we can all acknowledge that climate change is indeed a problem which is happening, if you don’t it’s probably pointless for you to read ahead.  The WEF had acknowledged the problem (great), and decided they alone hold the solutions.  This is my first issue with the Great Reset, because the ppl involved are same ppl who own/run the corporations who denied climate change and didn’t do anything to change their practices in the first place.  The Great Reset focuses on changes that need to be made by us the ppl, we are the only ones who need to sacrifice, while the elites continue to profit like never before.  The whole thing reeks of trying to preserve late stage capitalism and GDP/stock markets as a measure of economic success.  This isn’t a new model at all, it’s the same old song and dance where the rich get richer and poor become more, by virtue of eliminating the middle class.  

New types of financial products will be created, and instead of learning to be kind and live in harmony with nature we will be further removed from it than ever.  Anything that Monsanto is a large part of should scare you atleast a bit.

According to them a billion ppl will need to immigrate to 1st world countries due to climate change.  This is like a Koch Brothers wet dream of libertarian infinite cheap labour.

I’ve read lots of media that they’ve put out themselves and yeah, some of it sounds nice and even necessary, but things like restricting meat eating could probably be done by other means, except most solutions that are beneficial to the people or are (left-wing) populist in nature go against their globalization agenda.  I guess we’re gonna have to wait and see.

**“The Umbrella Man” and Modern JFK Conspiracy**

Ever since the day John F. Kennedy was fatally shot, conspiracy has swirled around his legacy, his family, and even agencies of the American government. Although these conspiracies appear to have dwindled over time, if you were to survey an American’s opinion on the matter, it would be quite likely that they subscribe to a conspiracy regarding the late President’s assassination. As of 2013, it is believed that around 62% of Americans believed in at least one JFK conspiracy theory (Todd, Chuck, et al.). 

Before we dive into a discussion of some of the most popular theories, it is important to recount the events around JFK’s assassination. JFK originally wanted to travel to Texas in attempts to unify the Democratic Party, and to garner support among Texan residents in attempts to win over the state in the upcoming Presidential election (Siegel). To carry out these unification attempts, Kennedy thought doing a motorcade right through the heart of Dallas would drum up public support. It was during this car ride that Kennedy was fatally shot by Lee Harvey Oswald, who was arrested promptly after the assassination. Later that same day, Jack Ruby, a nightclub owner, fatally shot Oswald at point-blank range. The President’s successor was sworn in, and JFK’s funeral was held the same day, with over 250,000 Americans passing by to pay their respects (“November 22, 1963: Death of the President”, Figure 1). 

[Figure 1. Photo titled The Funeral of John F. Kennedy.](https://preview.redd.it/jo2dbiwpz4b81.png?width=1358&format=png&auto=webp&s=b9d7bbc85ff3ff4117129b82bb7e765c38e7db81)

Upon interrogation, Oswald revealed himself to be a communist, and a supporter of the Soviet Union. And, although the Red Scare had occurred several decades prior, communism was still highly stigmatized in the 1960s. It is now known that Oswald briefly was welcomed into the Soviet Union after offering up classified information he learned during his time as a radio operator for the American military (Duran). Although Oswald was provided with a well-furnished apartment in the Union and was supplied with plenty of money, any work he found in the Soviet Union was too drab for him (Savodnik). Oswald contacted the U.S. Embassy, and was accepted back as a U.S. citizen with all charges against him for his military defection considered dropped (Duran). After his return to America, Oswald took up multiple jobs, none of which satisfied him, and even started a family in the States. Even though Oswald left the Soviet Union, he still strongly professed his communist beliefs, which made life in the anti-communist U.S. hard for him. In the months before JFK’s assassination, Oswald moved to Dallas and had contact with the Soviet Embassy in Mexico. Oswald even sent a threatening letter to the Dallas FBI office when he learned the FBI suspected him of espionage, and carried out an assassination attempt against the well-renowned anti-communist Edwin Walker just 6 months before he assassinated JFK (“Lee Harvey Oswald”).

Now that we understand the historical account of JFK’s assassination and more about Oswald’s history, widespread conspiracy surrounding the assassination is no surprise. From Oswald’s deep relations with Russia to his own sudden death at the hands of Jack Ruby, the series of unbelievable events surrounding JFK’s death were so unexpected that many believed the event had to be orchestrated by some higher power. It did not take long for various conspiracies to pop up amongst the American public, with over half of Americans believing in some sort of conspiracy surrounding JFK’s death the year it occurred (Figure 2). This percentage of conspiracy-believing Americans skyrocketed to above 80% from the late 70s until the early 2000s, and only began a downward trend after the release of the internet.

[Figure 2. Infographic depicting the percentage of surveyed Americans who believe in a greater conspiracy surrounding JFK’s assassination. The source at hand is NBC News with an article titled: “The One Thing All Americans Agree On: JFK Conspiracy” by Dante Chinni.](https://preview.redd.it/2eb2pwxvz4b81.png?width=1362&format=png&auto=webp&s=c8b6e991e517453413371de2c0b76263be028fbd)

Referring to the above chart, the “others involved” classification is an umbrella term encompassing near every JFK assassination theory that involves any other party working with Lee Harvey Oswald. Some famous theories include CIA orchestration, deep-state Russian involvement, the “multiple shooter” theory, and the one theory I will be focusing on today: “The Umbrella Man.” 

It is believed “The Umbrella Man” is someone who knew about the shooting before it happened (Hallemann). The evidence for this theory, which I have shown below, was found in the “Zapruder film,” which has become quite famous since its release in 1989. The Zapruder film was a citizen’s recording of JFK’s motor parade through Dallas, Texas, in 1963.

The footage not only shows the motorcade–including the President being shot–but also shows a figure standing in the grass, dressed in all black and holding a black umbrella over his head. This figure has been dubbed the “Umbrella Man.” After many JFK conspiracies were disproven by the Zapruder film, conspiracists began to suspect that the Umbrella Man was an insider in JFK’s assassination. Some believe the man was present to provide a visible signal for Oswald to shoot JFK at his own discretion, and others believe he was wearing funeral attire to pay respects because he knew JFK would be killed that day. Some others even believe that the Umbrella Man shot a poisonous dart into JFK’s neck to immobilize him, making him the perfect target for Oswald’s fatal shot (Hallemann). Ever since the Zapruder footage has been released to the public, JFK conspiracists have created a swirl of fanaticism around his mysterious character, and the Umbrella Man has since become something akin to an urban legend.

[Figure 3. The famous “Umbrella Man” picture, which is a screenshot from the Zapruder Film \(The Zapruder Film: Reframing JFK's Assassination\).](https://preview.redd.it/gwe7z1u005b81.png?width=1222&format=png&auto=webp&s=bfe91232d7bb647339c334f73b8ae3d5d0164fc7)

Over a decade after JFK’s assassination, the Umbrella Man was revealed to be a Dallas insurance salesman by the name of Louie Steven Witt. He brought the black umbrella from that day before a jury to express its harmlessness in 1978. Witt revealed that he extended the black umbrella that day to “heckle” the President, as the black umbrella was something that one of JFK’s father’s associates carried as a trademark (Lardner). He expressed his distaste for the Kennedy family and their involvement with pro-Nazi political forces, but the jury concluded he was not guilty. Conspiracists discount this court hearing, proposing that perhaps the FBI investigated the wrong man, and believing Witt’s testimony was a mere coverup. Some believe that the umbrella presented before the jury couldn’t possibly have been the same black umbrella present at JFK’s assassination over a decade prior. And, as it is with many conspiracy theories, it is more difficult to disprove something than it is to prove. 

For a theory centered around events that happened over fifty years ago, it is difficult to build an argument on historical evidence, as the evidence may be viewed as outdated or corrupted by those who were covering up what really happened. And, even though I have just presented the most important evidence we have against the Umbrella Man theory, I think it’s even more important to understand why this theory is still perpetrated today. 

The Zapruder Film was released in 1989, and it allowed professionals to computer-analyze the bullets’ trajectories. The analysis isolated the bullets’ origin to the window Oswald shot from, and provided solid evidence against many JFK conspiracy theories, such as the multiple shooter theory (Blakemore). Thus, people turned to other conspiracy theories that are not based in evidence, but instead, in comforting ideology. 

All of the variations of the Umbrella Man conspiracy have something in common: the mysterious Umbrella Man was a figure of authority–whether he be a pro-Nazi sympathizer, an American government official, or part of some powerful underground syndicate. These theories are simple speculation, but they remain deep-rooted in the minds of many Americans. Though it may seem hard to identify, there is indeed reasoning behind the desire to believe in such authority-based conspiracy.

It is difficult to understand how one citizen could have so openly overthrown the highest authority in the country. It is even more difficult to comprehend how Oswald alone could have beaten all security measures, outsmarted the FBI, and murdered the President. Oswald’s own death created even more uncertainty, since Oswald was assassinated by yet another citizen, Jack Ruby, before any serious police interrogations could occur. Police were unable to collect Oswald’s testimony on the matter, since he refused any involvement in JFK’s death while he was in custody. Oswald’s early demise truly opens an enticing door for conspiracy, since it is easy to believe Oswald was silenced before he could explain the truth behind JFK's death in court. 

Although Ruby was trying to deliver justice by killing Oswald, Oswald’s sudden death shocked America, and left the country even more open to conspiracy. No one wanted to believe that we would never obtain an explanation from Oswald himself as to why and how he killed the President. Americans began to see how fragile the systems of authority and justice were in the United States, and began to realize that they could not be so trusting of their fellow citizens. Oswald was simply a military veteran who worked small jobs around the city, and Ruby was an ordinary Dallas nightclub operator. Rather than deal with this surmounting fear, it is easier to pin the blame on a powerful figure, such as the Umbrella Man. It is easier to understand the assassination if it was carried out by a figure of authority, rather than if it was carried out by a single citizen. 

It is also understandable that, in their frustration sourced in helplessness, many Americans wanted to have someone to blame for JFK’s death. They turned to blame the President’s successor–LBJ–and even blamed government agencies such as the CIA, who they believe feigned incompetence in order to speed up the removal of a President the CIA did not favor. These same individuals are susceptible to theories like “The Umbrella Man,” and they likely believe more than one conspiracy (Chinni).

In one of Netflix’s most popular shows, “The Umbrella Academy,” the JFK assassination was the subject of discussion for the entirety of the show’s second season (Hallemann). One of the main antagonists of the series had time-traveled and was revealed to be “The Umbrella Man,” playing on the theory that The Umbrella Man knew of the assassination and was present that day as a symbol of death. After watching through the entire season, I realized that the writing preys on themes of communism, and villainizes the Soviet Union, involving the Soviet government in time-travel and secret operations that “orchestrate” JFK’s assassination in the series. It is interesting to note that this season was released in 2020, beating out “The Witcher” in viewership and establishing itself as the most popular Netflix Original show of 2020 (VanAcker).

A poll run by NBC News states that, as of 2013, around 60% of Americans believe in some sort of conspiracy around JFK’s passing (Chinni). This number was almost twenty percent higher around the late 90s. Even though it has since declined, it is interesting that massive media productions such as The Umbrella Academy mentioned above are capable of preying on sensationalized conspiracy to appeal to a wide target audience.

Conspiracy is so effective because it preys on individuals searching for answers regarding events they cannot explain, or accept the answers to. It is much more common to believe in conspiracy, and at least 50% of surveyed Americans believe in at least one conspiracy theory (Vedantam). In recent years, experts have carried out their own research into the appeal of conspiracy. Conspiracies can provide a sense of belonging, as well as a sense of identity, in communities consisting of individuals with similar ideologies. Conspiracy can allow people to find refuge with others they identify with. This is a broad generalization that can be applied to many conspiracies. Different conspiracies can attract different subgroups of people, and these subgroups will ultimately compose that conspiracy’s community. If a conspiracy can take on a multitude of attractive qualities–say, the Umbrella Man theory’s capabilities to appeal to doubt in the U.S. government, to appeal to the “mystery authority” comfort, or even to serve as a simple figure of blame–then the conspiracy will likely become all the more widespread and impactful among subgroups with different ideologies.

Once conspiracy takes root in the mind, it is quite hard to dislodge if it appeals to someone’s ideals, has provided that individual with a sense of community, or empowered that individual in any other way (Leandowsky, Cook, et. al.). It is notable to again mention that many people believe in at least one conspiracy theory. It is no shame to have your own doubts about JFK’s death, 9/11, the moon landing, or any other conspiracy theory. What matters is that you ask yourself “why” you feel attracted to believe in a conspiracy, and to analyze the credibility of the evidence set before you by other conspiracists. It is even more important to gather and analyze evidence from non-conspiracists in order to have a full understanding of whatever topic is at hand. And, it is ultimately up to you to understand why a certain conspiracy attracts you so much, and whether belief in the conspiracy can be potentially harmful to you or others. Some extreme conspiracists can cut themselves off from non-believers, including friends and family members (Nordstrom). 

Finally, as an individual tasked with discerning conspiracy, it is important that you stay aware of the aforementioned predatory tendencies of conspiracy, keep an open mind, and be an informed consumer of information.

541,conspiracytheories,The Doomsday Glacier and the movement of the ocean currents full of ammonia and halocarbon “Freon” refrigerants melting it…like snowy roads and salt in the winter…,"Ammonia refrigerants and any of the many halocarbon “Freon” refrigerants used to keep stuff cold (including refrigerators, spaceship rockets and both oil/electric cars) and also found in high concentrations in landfill/waste areas like India have what in common?

They all run into the groundwater that reaches the ocean eventually and also evaporates into the clouds, causing acid rainfall and contaminated ocean currents which “ironically” if you follow the natural ocean currents is melting the “Doomsday Glacier” that is coming for us all deep underneath the Antarctic.

The ammonia/halocarbons/other toxins humans dump, found collecting within the dance of the ocean currents is causing the ice to melt resulting in this huge glacier to break off and oceans to rise, will also be a major factor in the poles suddenly changing by 1 degree…considering a big land mass that slowly over time melts is melting at supersonic speeds suddenly…

Wonder once the coastlines with major corporations all go under water like the new American money predicts when you fold it a certain way (a big tidle wave hitting New York like in the movie A Day After Tomorrow movie)… who will be the people to profit from this happening? Hence celebrities and other elites moving from the coastlines who seem to already have a clue as to what’s going on… 


Ammonia refrigerants and any of the many halocarbon “Freon” refrigerants greatly effect the water nitrogen cycle, which causes the water to become more salty (killing all kinds of fish and other animals/plants and humans, bc their natural cell processes cannot function properly with these slight yet immense changes that WILL NEGATIVELY IMPACT EVERYONE!!!!

They are saying as the iceberg melts it will in other words, “dilute” the extra salty ocean into freshwater again. DO NOT fall for this!!!! It’s only a temporary solution. Once the ice is all melted and humans mindlessly continue using this stuff worldwide and recontaminate the Earth there will be nothing but death left.

And I wouldn’t be so sure to trust the Antarctic water they are selling as bottled water, remember the currents…everything collects up there bc of the main magnetic North Pole…Including all the toxic salts (melting icebergs/ozone depletion…similar to the nasty salt that gets spread on the icy or snowy roads so it immediately melts….so is it truly “pure water”?

A lot of these “chemicals” are in their strongest salt-like crystal state….and salt becomes invisible in water… 

Plus, everyone eating fish and sushi, be careful!!! Remember that ALL nasty toxins we use will eventually end up in the water. 

Another interesting thing to think about…
”Alkaline, anoxic or warm water: Water characteristics that promote ammonia formation (e.g., anoxia) or increase toxicity (e.g., high pH and temperature) are signs that ammonia may be a cause.”*

Aka Alkaline bottled water is probably has high ammonia concentrations making it Alkaline…

548,conspiracytheories,Twitch.tv fame is not real and the plan to enslave the world,"Think streamers on [Twitch.tv](https://Twitch.tv) are actually famous? Think again.

So essentially what they do is have one human chatter type something, then have an advanced algorithm echo that message in different variations through many bot accounts. For example: the human chatter will say ""Pog"" in reaction to something that happens on the screen, to which you'll have about 80% of the bots echo that same message.

The other 20% will be saying something related to ""Pog"", but less popular such as ""Wow"" or ""Nice"", or some silly emote. To make it even more believable, they'll have the occasional typos in these messages. All of this gives an illusion that there are actual viewers and chatters in the stream.

But why would they do this you might ask? Twitch wants to promote streamers that support their views and agenda, especially ones that promote the degradation of society itself. Just take a look at the ""Just Chatting"" section for instance. That section is filled with a bunch of almost butt naked women that don't have any respect for themselves or anyone for that matter. It's quite sad that a platform filled with young children that go on Twitch to watch their favorite streamers play the game that they like, are eventually exposed to this garbage on Twitch. Just the fact that this stuff is allowed on Twitch speaks volumes about the leadership on Twitch itself.

Also, what a coincidence that most of the top streamers hold very leftist views. Where are all the top Christian streamers who actually stand up for their views? But no, we just so happen to have these leftist streamers at the top who don't care to set a good example to their impressionable audiences.  All that matters to them is lining their own pockets and that they get bigger houses and better luxurious cars.

Basically, they create a pack mentality to which the younger audiences want to be accepted in. What I mean by this is that they laugh and mock at others who don't hold the same views as them. And since the need to be accepted is very strong in these young viewers, they eventually adopt these same views as these streamers in order to not feel left out or be called ""weird"".

This creates a ripple effect to where you now have the majority of society believing in these same views, who will then also shut down others who hold ""weird"" viewpoints in a similar manner as these big streamers did to them.

All of this reinforces the views of the ""cool kids"" group, which all feeds into the main perpetrators of the world and their plan of the gradual degradation and eventual destruction of society itself.

And if this is all happening on twitch, how much more on other social media platforms? Take YouTube for example: it's very evident that they are trying to control the narrative so much so to the point where they now disabled dislikes on their entire platform. Basically, they are trying to micromanage the narrative of all these social media platforms down to even the smallest levels.

Heck, dare I say that the internet as a whole is a literal net so to speak, in order to trap the majority of society. They are making society so hopelessly dependent on technology, to the point where they can force the majority of the population into their world. Then once they have everyone on their turf, they can easily control the narrative and shut down anyone who opposes them. This can be through ""hacking"", shadow-banning, ridicule, or cancel culture.

The climax to all of this is tying basic human necessities to technology itself, AKA the implementation of the Mark of the beast. The plan goes something like this: 1. Create fake pandemic, 2. Make everyone scared through news, 3. Enforce lockdowns, 4. Promise freedom with vaccines, 5. Promise freedom with microchipping society, 6. Force everyone to take microchip by only allowing the purchase of food through having the microchip, 7. All who are microchipped will be excluded from eternal salvation. (Rev 14:11)

Think this is a stretch? Just look up ""Sweden Microchip"" and you'll see that they have already developed this kind of technology. It's only a matter of time before other countries start adopting this technology, and to begin restrictions on buying and selling to those not microchipped. (Rev 13:17)

Of course, I could be wrong, and the mark of the beast could come to fruition in a different generation. But due to the uncanny similarities in the unfolding of the events in the world with biblical scripture, it's becoming nearly impossible to ignore. And I believe it is in my duty as a fellow human being to warn you before it's too late.

Is this thing a political cult?","The worse the Republican politicians get, the more screwed up and insane, the more madly these people fall in love with them.

Is this just cult worship?

They all groom themselves to hate Biden and the Democrats and always love the Republican Masters more.

Like I think Biden is a great President, but if also tried to murder Congress and was screaming ""ELECTION FAKE! ME SAD!"" I'd be telling people to vote against the freak.

Trump can basically do anything at this point and they will always love and worship him more.

Is Republicanism just a self-deluding insanity cult?

They insist Biden is a failure but mentally block out the absolute freakshow failures of Republican depravity?

Like, would Republicans prefer it if Biden also launches a suicide terrorist attack on the Capitol?

Obama and Biden created America's first climate change plan and lowered emissions for the first time in US History.

Trump and the Republicans shredded those plans and raised emissions, which is literally burning us all alive.

Trump and the GOP didn't even have a policy platform in 2020. They literally don't even have to do anything to win their followers unlimited love and devotion.

Biden passed his infrastructure plan, he wants to get high speed internet to all our rural communities.

Trump is praising Jan. 6 as his greatest accomplishment. That disgusting retard only wants to watch his cultists fight and die for his pleasure.

So unless Biden also tries to murder Congress, why wouldn't all Americans vote for him and not the Trump-Bobert-McConnell-Bush failure factory?

Are Republicans just addicted to being failures and cucks?

The worse the GOP gets, the more they love them and hate ""Demon-crats.""

Like why not vote for the guy with the climate change plan? You know, the VP for Obama, who was easily the best president of my 30 year lifetime?

Is that really so difficult to grasp?

Trump is still screaming antifah Clinton stole the election emails from him. He is openly demanding they give him more votes to make him the big boy President.

Biden is not doing that. Doesn't Biden refusing to kill Congress and the VP make him infinitely better than the Republicans?

Biden wants to invest in pre-K. Republicans are banning abortions but refuse to invest anything in childcare.

The Republican climate change plan is to deny it exists and scream FAKE DUMB until we all burn to death.

Why are Republicans still so loyal to the GOP Masters after six years of this Trump Freakshow failure?

Does Trump need to wear the Constitution as a diaper before they let go of him?

Is Republicanism just a sad incel cult that spins conspiracies to justify any insanity and treason?

574,conspiracytheories,"Prometheus, Loki And Lucifer","Have you ever pondered on how the mythologies have connected to each other? Sure, we might notice some few obscure similarities but upon further inspection, some things look rather...odd.

I'll be making separate posts based on these few things I've noticed in all these mythologies. Firstly, let's point out the ones within Norse Mythology, Greek Mythology and even some thing from the Bible. Now, I understand not everyone here is Christian and neither am I but it doesn't take a Christian to realize this biblical book may carry more answers to Mythology connections than we realize. 

Let's start with Greece. So we have Prometheus, the greek god of fire. Also, known to be a trickster. He had introduced fire to humanity and was immediately punished for it, being cast aside and chained to a rock. There, an eagle would rip and tear out his guts. A form of torture.

Now with Norse, we have Loki. Also known as a trickster and even a god associated with fire. He too caused some troubles and was cast aside to punishment, tortured to be chained down with the venom of a snake dripping on his body. 

Before I get to the last bit, I'll have to point out that the fact these two gods were tortured by both a snake and eagle is interesting because in many acnient civilizations, symbols and flags there is an eagle and a snake. Very common symbology. I wonder if it even means anything.

Now, onto the bible, we have Lucifer. Bearer of light. We often do associate him with fire as well, seeing as he's on the demonic side of things. He too was cast aside, fallen from heaven. And yes, he is also associated with snakes. 

Now the connections I'm implying to be a possibility may be a bit of a stretch but it is indeed rather curious. It makes you wonder how much more connections can we dig out? What if....our mythologies pertain to our actual history? Could such stories of these gods, high beings, giants and civilizations can tell us much more about our past than our history books? Let me know of your thoughts.

I will have to post some more similarities. Let me know if you have a few as well. I'd love to hear them. Good day.",rxq380,75,,1641506170.0,31,0.88

587,conspiracytheories,Earth reproduction theory.," 

Hi, so I like the idea that the earth is a living organism as itself. I was thinking about how can earth reproduce and I think I came up with a good explanation.

The basic idea is: Humans will always create some civilization until the point where they are overpopulated and start running short of resources, you need some pretty advanced civilization to overpopulate and start running short of natural resources, at this point, it's natural that this civilization has a group of elites. Then it's really simple, just take the group of elites, put crapload of technologies, food, etc. into some underground bunker with the elites, wipe 99% of the human population, wait until earth recovers from the last civilization and the survivors of your wipeout will naturally form new primitive civilization.  
Yea this could take thousands of years but you just need to invent cryosleep and time is no problem. You can even wipe out whole humanity and select a few humans to put into cryosleep then release them when the earth is regenerated and let them make a primitive civilization without them remembering the old one.  
There are more ways to do that but the point is to make primitive civilization. Then it's easy peasy. The elite will wake up with their badass technologies and present themself to primitive civilization as gods. Help them develop a little, enslave them, let them build you a colonizing spaceship and then you just leave earth and colonize a new planet far away from earth, good job you just made a new life planet.  
Also, you leave some civilization on earth who will probably think that you were god and just get ascended to heaven. This civilization will eventually become the civilization you once were and then just rinse and repeat and you end up with one civilization on earth that will keep producing new life on planets for infinite. Just don't let the earth know you exist on some planet and this process can be done  infinitely. 

It can go deeper this is just the basics.

It is a theory however I’m not sure how conspiracy it is. It started from the conspiracy theory iceberg however so this is where I will put it. 

It began when I heard wendigoon say that the notion of “I think therefore I am” is a justification of our existence because of our thoughts and does that not mean that because we exist means our thoughts exist as well? That means that if we think something it can and will come into the world as we know it because it is our existing selves that thought it. 

I took that train of thought onto that of parallel universes and thought, Is the parallel universe/multiverse theory not just each of our own parallel perspectives coexisting but existing separately yet simultaneously? And given that our thoughts come into actuality so do our separate worlds. We use our thought to construct a world as we perceive it and this perception through thought creates something entirely separate from any other world. 

As a Roman Catholic, my thoughts then turned to God. If God made us in his exact image and likeness and gave us free Will to think and act, then he gifted us both the existence and thought that justify us and our world of perception. It could be reasoned that God created us using the same thought he gave us. What if we are just the thoughts of a higher order of ourselves and our existence justifies its existence? And does that not give us the power to be a God of thought in our own right?

In particular, it might seem that if we observe all other galaxies to be moving away from us, then we must be at the center of the universe. There is, however, an alternate explanation: the universe might look the same in every direction as seen from any other galaxy too. This, as we have seen,was Friedmann's second assumption. We have no scientific evidence for, or against, this assumption. We believe it on the grounds of modesty.

George Ellis, a famous cosmologist, in Scientific American, ""Thinking Globally, Acting Universally"", October 1995
“People need to be aware that there is a range of models that could explain the observations,” Ellis argues. “For instance, I can construct you a spherically symmetrical universe with Earth at its center, and you cannot disprove it based on observations.” Ellis has published a paper on this. ""You can only exclude it on philosophical grounds. In my view there is absolutely nothing wrong in that. What I want to bring into the open is the fact that we are using philosophical criteria in choosing our models. A lot of cosmology tries to hide that.”

And lastly, Edwin Hubble’s damning quote that speaks for itself.


“Such a condition would imply that we occupy a unique position in the universe, analogous, in a sense, to the ancient conception of a central earth. The hypothesis cannot be disproved but it is unwelcome and would be accepted only as a last resort in order to save the phenomena. Therefore, we disregard this possibility and consider the alternative, namely, a distribution which thins out with distance.” “A thinning out would be readily explained in either of two ways. The first is space absorption. If the nebulae were seen through a tenuous haze, they would fade away faster than could be accounted for by distance and red-shifts alone, and the distribution, even if it were uniform, would appear to thin out. The second explanation is a super-system of nebulae, isolated in a larger world, with our own nebula somewhere near the centre. In this case the real distribution would thin out after all the proper corrections had been applied. Both explanations seem plausible, but neither is permitted by the observations. The apparent departures from uniformity in the World Picture are fully compensated by the minimum possible corrections for redshifts on any interpretation. No margin is left for a thinning out. The true distribution must either be uniform or increase outward, leaving the observer in a unique position. But the unwelcome supposition of a favoured location must be avoided at all costs….Such a favoured position, of course, is intolerable … Therefore, in order to restore homogeneity, and to escape the horror of a unique position, the departures from uniformity, which are introduced by the recession factors, must be compensated by the second term representing effects of spatial curvature. There seems to be no other escape.“ -Edwin Hubble

My political beliefs cannot be put into only 1 of 2 sides. For example, I believe police should be abolished but I also believe Americans should be able to own any firearm they please to defend themselves with no government intrusion. However, recently somehow some way I found myself on “Q” side of TikTok….and my god!

I’ve always enjoyed history, along with the occasional conspiracy theory. Nothing too radical but I believe there are many things done that the common public has no knowledge of. But I was bored so I went down the rabbit hole per say for a few hours. And may I say these people are batshit crazy. Now now, I understand the further left or right you go on either side the more radical the beliefs. I dare to say these people have taken it to a new level. Perhaps I’ll give you an example of one of the more “tame” theories these nutcases have: 
DJT is still the president, Joe Biden was hung at GITMO, the guy in the Whitehouse is Jim Carey in a Biden body suit and Betty White died because DJT used the US Marshall’s to cut the supply of Adrenachrome (look it up if you dare) to her and thats what was keeping her alive….yeah….

Naturally I wanted to ask questions, so I simply asked “do you have any proof of this” (wrong statement) when asked for proof the Q people got VERY defensive. Almost immediately my dms were flooded with DuckDuckGo urls and I woke up to 1067 notifications. Most of which consisted of statements like: “do your own research”, “you sheep will never wake up”, “gods gonna cut you down”, “open your eyes”, “90% of Holywood is on adrenachrome” and one common denominator was most of the were either old men or middle aged stay at home moms…

I would call myself the furthest thing from a “sheep” as they say I mean I hate virtually all government and simply want to be left alone with my dog, livestock and plants to feed myself. Anyway, these people are fucking crazy….",rukp1j,71,,1641161006.0,107,0.82

It just makes sense, not being allowed to properly advertise and facing a dwindling youth market the companies used shadow money to have reality show producers to apply extra focus on the act of smoking whenever it appeared.

It's a relatively safe venture as well, because unless the producer decides to incriminate themselves it would likely never get out.

The avg smoker will smoker about $3000 dollars per year. If flavor of love managed to have even .001% of its 7 million viewers buy cigarettes, that would be a revenue of 21 million dollars in a year. (7000  * 3000)

659,conspiracytheories,Interesting quote from a book I just finished:," In a renewed effort to train archers, an ordinance was issued prohibiting games. Tennis, which the common people were adopting in imitation of the nobles, and soules, a form of field hockey popular with the bourgeois and seldom played without broken bones, as well as dice and cards, were banned in the hope of encouraging practice in archery and the crossbow. This was the same effort Charles V had made in 1368 and it shows that the rulers were acutely conscious of the failure of French archery. Skills were not lacking; the trouble was that French tactics did not allow archery an essential place.

 Combined action of archers and knights was not adopted; crossbow companies were hired and barely used. The reason was clearly a mixture of contempt for the commoner and fear for chivalry’s primacy in battle. By 1393 the added fear of insurrection caused the new ordinance to have a short life**. After a period during which practice with the bow and crossbow became very popular, the nobles insisted that the ban on games be revoked, fearing that the common people would gain too effective a weapon against the noble estate.** They were caught in that common irony of human endeavor when one self-interest cancels out another.

667,conspiracytheories,Aliens are among us,"  

Okay this is a crazy one, hang with me. 

Aliens are among us and they look just like us, behave like us, but they don’t think like us. 

The aliens have a mothership which is their sentral hub for communication and oversight.   
 Here all variables are accounted for by their AI and the most likely series of events (happening down on earth) is calculated. What events will happen, but not how we handle it. And they can communicate this trough text and speech found in random places, but mostly news on TV and online newspapers. 

The males are injected with a special serum that changes the DNA of the sperm before the female gets pregnant. The DNA is precoded but needs time for incubation.    
 Before the DNA was implanted, it was perfected to fit the ongoing events and calculate good questions which would be hardcoded in the DNA.   
 They have telepathic powers, but only sent from the alien-humans to the mothership, so the telepathy goes only from earth to mothership. That’s why they have clever placed text in news outlets. The questions would then appear in the alien-humans mind. The questions would then be answered in order on these news sites and the alien on earth would know what answer belong to which question, by the order of the questions. There are specific sentences that fits the question perfectly and then the alien on earth would communcate this telepathically to the aliens on the mothership.

By my horrible formulation of this, I’m guessing there’s a lot of questions which I might not know the answer to, but I can ask you this: Why would the aliens do this to us? I can tell you: TO TEST US!  
 With their own alien-humans on earth they can get a first person view of how we behave and treat each other in relation to different challenges/events. They want to see if we are fit for a first contact and if we deserve to go multi-planetary. 

This all relies on us. Treat eachother well and be kind! And we might not see a much deadlier and far more spreading pandemic that will end us all. It’s up to us.",rrcxgs,12,,1640797479.0,28,0.69

How did Trump and his Republicans do it?

Just by screaming the same message over and over, millions will now forever fight for the politicians to take control of our election systems to always make Republican politicians winners.

Anytime a Democratic politician wins to fight climate change or raise taxes on the rich, Republicans will mass scream it's FAKE and SAD and throw out the votes to install themselves in power.

They all believe the blacks caused Jan. 6 and stole the election, and Trump and his Republicans need to be forced into power at all costs.

How did this happen? Why are so many people so infinitely loyal to the Republican government, even when Republican's only goal is insane tax cuts to the rich and suicidal climate change denial and amassing infinite power at all their expenses?

How did Republican politicians roll this massive support amongst the people who most suffer from their rich-first policies?

Americans are now freely signing away their right to vote in free and fair elections so the Republican Masters will always have unlimited power over them.

They didn't even have a policy platform in 2020. They don't even have to promise to do anything real anymore to win elections. Just feed total batshit insanity on Fox News, hate ""libtards"" and feed conspiracies targeted at all their enemies.

Obama and Biden created the first major climate change plan and lowered emissions for the first time in US history, which is the only way to stop climate change. And Republicans slashed those plans and raised emissions, which is literally burning us all alive.

Tax cuts to the rich, election manipulation, cult grooming.

What is the Republican Party? How did they accomplish this total destruction of the American electorate, where you don't even need real policies anymore to win unlimited loyalty from middle and lower class Americans?

Rather than solve real problems, they just groom their own fantasy world where Trump is not insane and mentally retarded, and people only don't like him because they are mean and biased and watch too much CNN.

   * where we go one (the victim) we go all (gangstalkers)

   * enjoy the show they write (gangstalking/gaslighting the victim into doing and thinking crazy things while they observe)

   * timing is everything they say (street theater, color codes, gestures and directed speech requires perfect timing)

*  Adrenochrome from high levels of stress when realizing you are being stalked everywhere, paranoia, people can read your mind, your house is being broken in to etc.(they talk about the celebrities drinking blood, they actually refer to the victim producing adrenochrome and being the celeb)

 *  symbolism will be their downfall (once sensitized to gangstalking signs you will go crazy, hence your downfall)

  *  a lot of religious bullshit evil vs.good (gangstalkers vs victim)

  *  from darkness to light (being in the shaddows as an anonymous person before gangstalking intensifies to being in the center of attention where your every move is watched)

* gangstalkers doing Q sign in front of you

* the celebrities and politicians being symbolism for the actual victims being gangstalked (their names will be known to each household they write, just like a celebrity)

   *  satanic rituals are actually the gangstalking and it is actually the Q cult that is worshipping satan

   *  wearing gods armour as a victim is the only way out

   *  the holy grail they mention(mind reading chips implanted in the victims scalp so the gangstalkers can use your thoughts against you and be a step ahead of you always)

   *  killing babies is just that they start gangstalking people at a young age I suppose not sure on this

   *  these people (referring to the victims) are sick they write ( well they try to gaslight you into a psychotic meltdown while they enjoy the so called show, that is sick! )

  *  victims are starting mass school shootings per design when the gangstalking start to intensify their efforts

   * celebrities did Q signs such as michelle obama on her front cover book...it makes no sense if the Qult is against these ""evil"" celebrities if they are in it. This is a big give away. ""satanic"" celebrities like cara delevigne doing the q sign while on a talk show host (forgotten the episode and the host but remember her making the sign) so how come these evil evil celebs are in on it? they like being witchhunted? don't think so.

I have kept it at a bare minimum but the pices of the puzzle all fell into the right places once I realized the symbolism they use and that I've seen gangstalkers do the Q sign waving their arms.",rq0wfa,2,,1640648910.0,14,0.55

That's what all our top experts are saying, that's how all vaccines work in all outbreaks.

The conspiracy here is that malicious agents are fueling total bullshit distrust against the vaccine to sabotage us.

Politicians and foreign powers are fueling resistance against the vaccine to sabotage our health and economy.

It's like a *reverse conspiracy*, where the real truth is the one we all know, and the conspiracy theories are the weapons of hostile forces.

The vaccine has risks and side effects like all drugs, but the virus also has risks and side effects obviously.

I've lived in dictatorships, this lockdown shit isn't something any government wants.

Getting vaccinated helps stop lockdowns.

Politicians and and foreign powers are seeding conspiracies and sowing distrust about everything, including our vaccines, to create hostile communities inside America.

Their vaccine shit is exactly like their climate change denial - it's the same damn playbook. The politicians are seeding vaccine hatred, and will then use the damaged economy and deaths to blame the government in charge and profit off our misery.

They are prolonging this crisis to win elections and power (and probably kill off the less controllable base).

That's also why Trump is fighting with Candace Owens and his QAnon fans over the vaccine: They're killing off his base, and using the vaccine issue to create division between Trump and his followers.

Trump is losing power while the political party is carefully pulling over control of his supporters. The more that die, the more power tips over to non-QAnon members in the primaries.

Simultaneously, they can blame the Democrats for ""vaccine mandates"" and the bad economy, weaken the QAnon element in the party by killing them off in massive numbers, and pull in massive support for fighting vaccines and prolonging this plague for hundreds of millions of people for years.

All of us are suffering because of this party that commits gross violations out in the open, then denies it as ""fake news"" and feeds its own fantasy reality to justify any freakshow insanity.",rpyw6g,0,,1640643370.0,50,0.49

693,conspiracytheories,Elon Musk Cloned Himself,"Hello all! This is my first Reddit post ever, so sorry if any parts are confusing. 

This is an interesting theory I’ve come up with an I surprisingly haven’t found any people who’ve come up with anything similar so I thought I should make a post. 

I’m not saying it’s 100% true, or that it’s even likely. But I instead want to point it out as a possibility.

So you know how Elon Musk is like, rich and pretty smart guy. Well think about this.

If you were that rich and talented, one of the people who is moving our civilization forward, single handedly advancing us in many different fields, You might have a bit of an ego to you right? 
And if you had such an ego, what do you think you would think about leaving the world behind after you die. You might think “oh, the world really needs someone like me”. So he would want to leave the world with a legacy right? And what better way than with kids. But you know what would be better than normal kids?? 

Clones. 

Of Elon musks current 6 children, 2 were twins and 3 are triplets. All 6 are dudes btw. Crazy odds right? Especially since it’s the woman, not the man, whose DNA determines the possibility of twins. And they also all look a lot like him (I know, they’re his kids so this is expected but whatever haha).

Not to mention, all of the children of the triplets and twins were conceived in vitro. We know scientists have the skills and technology to create clones (I.e dolly the sheep).
So what if..
When they were fertilizing the eggs, they used only Elon’s dna so they could create clones of him. Sound crazy? 
Well even though it’s not impossible, what are the chances that all of his kids would be boys.
(1/2)^6 Or 1/64. Not bad.
But the chances that he would have twins AND triplets (keep in mind they can be counted as seperate events since they both happened in different women, and women are the ones who determine the likelyhood of twins and triplets)
It’s also worth noting that he had his kids with two seperate women, as he remarried.

Anyways, chances of twins:
1/250 pregnancies 

Triplets? 
1/9000

1/64 * 1/250 * 1/9000

1/144,000,000 odds

.0000007% chance 

I’m not saying that it’s definitely true, but if it came out that Elon Musk kids are actually clones of himself, I wouldn’t be surprised. 

Note: if anyone has any insight on improve and making the math more accurate please drop it below for the betterment of the post. I don’t mean to mislead people, so it’s important to acknowledge that my math is almost definitely not entirely accurate. I mean, multiplying probabilities is certainly the correct way to predict independent events occurring simultaneously, but the events here aren’t necessarily independent. First off, I think in vitro increases the odds of twins and triplets, and second, people who have had twins might be more likely to have triplets. Anyone with insight to improve the numbers, please drop them in the comments below.

Anyways, this is just a fun post and I’m excited to know what you all think. Keep in mind it’s almost definitely not true, so don’t parade it or any of my numbers like fact. Instead, if it’s something that interests you, I encourage you to do further research on your own.

707,conspiracytheories,"Matrix Resurrections - Spitting Truth in the Face of all us ""Sheeple""","I wrote a post about the new Matrix movie essentially being a co-opting of the original by the powers that be and how a character called ""The Analyst"" represents these powers (corporate silicon valley oligarchs). All of this character's lines are gold and are telling. If you want to know how the corporate elite see humanity, just listen to this character's lines. The Matrix Resurrections is a blatant unmasking, dropping the performative lies the elites have been telling. They are being totally honest in the movie, and what's more, they are 99.9% correct in their analysis. So here is the bulk of The Analyst's lines from the movie to get a sense for what I mean:

(one of his first lines) - ""I hate lying, it exhausts me.""

""Allow me to sum up our goal in one word, ""bullet time"".""(obviously two words, a nod to how stupid and dumbed down the audience is that they probably won't even point this out because the movie is marketed as a ""serious movie"".)

""This rewind is happening faster than you can blink. You gave me the idea. ... ... ... I know, kind of ironic. Using the power that defined you to control you.""(drawing parallels between Neo's ability to doge bullets by speeding himself up/ slowing time down and the internet dawning of the new millenium > faster transfer of information and communication > turns into blogs then social media > which are then used to control the exchange of information and people's communication.)

""I know this may be difficult to hear, after everything you've been through, all that pain and suffering... the world doesn't end when you do... Surprise!""

""Did you know Hope and Despair are nearly identical in code?""

""...he never bothered to realize that you don't give a shit about facts, it's all about fiction. The only world that matters is the one in here (pointing to Neo's head). And you people believe the craziest shit. Why? What validates and makes your fictions real? Feelings.""

""You ever wonder why you have nightmares? Why your own brain tortures you? Actually, it's us, maximizing your output.""

""Here's the thing about feelings, they're so much easier to control than facts.""

""Turns out in my Matrix, the worse we treat you, the more we manipulate you, the more energy you produce, it's nuts! I've been setting productivity records every year since I took over. And! The best part, zero resistance! People stay in their pods, happy like pigs in shit.""

""The key to it all, you... and her, quietly yearning for what you don't have, whie dreading losing what you do. For 99.9% of your race, that is THE definition of reality. Desire and fear, baby. Just give the people what they want, right?""

\--------------------------------------Ending Scene:

Trinity - ""So why haven't the suits purged you?""Analyst - ""Because I know the system. I know human beings, and I know you.""

""Right now you're feeling good about what you've done. You should, it was a victory, bravo. Now what?""

""You think you hold all the cards because you can do whatever you want in this world? I say go for it, knock yourself out, paint the sky with rainbows. But here's the thing, the sheeple aren't going anywhere. They like my world. They don't like this... this sentimentality. They don't want freedom or empowerment. They want to be controlled. They crave the comfort of certainty, and that means you two (gesturing to Neo and Trinity) back in your pod, unconscious and alone, just like them.""

&#x200B;

So there ya go, out in the open for all to see. But that's the whole point of the entire movie. They can be this blatant, this honest, and nothing will change. People will reject the truth even when it is shoved in their faces and they'll go on pretending in the matrix of their fictitious beliefs because it is more safe feeling and convenient. The entire movie is an omage to this, the Analyst just sums it up nicely. Really, when you truly see this ""movie"" you realize it isn't a movie at all, it's a big middle finger and an open book in the form of a mirror for people to see exactly what they want to see.

   First off it seems tiktok has created a sort of hive mind. Social media is famous for this, but in tiktoks case it’s v stark. Not only have Tiktok trends and vocabulary and music started bleeding into everyday life, but tiktok has seemed to have formed a homogeneous culture of its own. Again Not new as text abbreviations and hashtags have made their way into standard language, but this was just the first thing I noticed. 
   What has me mostly concerned with is how vapid and even violent kids are becoming lately. I work in a group home with several residents who attend public school so I have somewhat of a front row seat. A little over a week ago their school moved to online learning only for the rest of the year following a fire being set in the bathroom, leading to a brawl outside after everyone had evacuated featuring a gun, knives, and a sibling of a student pulling up and passing out lead pipes (you can’t make this shit up). The unsettling part was this happened on the day that a tiktok trend called “National shoot up your school day” was supposed to happen. 

   And this isn’t the only thing like this happening. Apparently there’s tiktok trends going around calling for everything from vandalism to assaulting staff members. You can google this shit. And all this shit has happened in schools near me. One school in a mostly white suburb near me had a bathroom covered wall to wall in racial slurs. 

  The cherry on top of the cake (that made me piece all this together) was an NPR piece that I heard on my way home from work tonight. They interviewed several teachers from around the country who report feeling burnt out because school kids this year are too much to handle. They won’t stay in their seat, they fight constantly, don’t care much for school work, and most importantly they’re constantly on their phones. And these are high school students. High school.They admitted that this is stuff you see during a normal school year but this year is “exponentially worse”. They made specific mention of the tik tok trends. Furthermore ever single time something like this happens involving tiktok they say something like “we take these things very seriously” and don’t do Jack shit. 

  Maybe it’s all bullshit or mass hysteria but I noticed this with the kids I work with weeks ago and now it’s national news. Could be a coincidence or I could just be cynical but I truly think something weird is happening with teenagers rn. I’m not typically a conspiracy theorist but the Chinese government using one of their largest companies as a psychological weapon to weaken American schools and thus American society? Crazier things have happened

He is very very bad and clearly hostile to the majority of people who voted his ass out of office.

Trying to ""overturn"" America's election and force himself into power over everyone against their consent is as gross as it sounds.

Trump is a hostile threat to Americans, and as long as he has power in this political party, this entire political party is a threat America as well.

The conspiracy is this corrosive shit traitor is still getting massive votes across the country.

Retired military generals are warning of the threat of civil war if Trump or some freak like him gets lots of votes. This entire Party is ratfucking America's elections in plain sight and blaming both sides for it.

Lots of people regardless of political spectrum or intelligence are getting lost in an increasingly growing information system where our sense of community is being warped.

But at the same time, I've read all of Trump's Tweets and I say without bias that he is blatantly a freak threat to the United States, and people need to stop voting for this Republican Party in large numbers or they're going to crash the country into the dirt again and again forever.

It's not a culture thing, trying to steal people's right to vote openly accusing us of stealing votes is obviously unacceptable hostility.

You don't have to trust CNN absolutely. But when journalists are reporting a war or a pandemic or climate change, and that's being blocked out by ""RADICAL LIBTARDS DUR!"", this is a massive problem.

Mainstream media has challenges and limits and some politics. But this is true of all information sources. Everything you read see and hear everywhere is just as suspect to influence as mainstream media if not more.

This thing of ""do your own research"" seems to mean dismiss actual science and make up your own fantasy world reading bullshit on the internet.

Does anyone seriously believe they have the intelligence to ""research"" their own solutions to this pandemic, which even the most knowledgeable people on the face of the planet are learning new things about day-to-day?

Our greatest experts say wearing masks work, it lowers spread.

But these people listen to conservative media cultists fueling absolute batshit insanity and spreading ""alternative science"" and share studies that purport to disprove masks.

This is a culture of know-nothing red-pilling and gaslighting each other with bullshit they found on the internet.

These people will instictively block out real information and the consequences of their actions and cling to fantasies created by conservative media cultists just feeding people with endless positive validation.

They've created an army of conspiracy cultists who claim they are rejecting the ""government narrative"", but instead completely absorb cult fantasies with zero care where they came from.

This is Republican culture that Donald Trump emulated for them.

All our best scientitists are fake and dumb, and only Joe Rogan and Tucker Carlson are feeding them the real super secret truth.

This culture is blinding arrogance and stupidity masquerading as ""critical thinking.""

Arguing for decades about climate change, arguing about vaccines, about masks, about our elections.

If you are flying on a plane, how many people would burst into the cockpit and throw the pilot out of their seat and say ""I know how to fly this plane! I've done the research!""

This is a culture with an information system based on following whatever bullshit the conservative media feeds them while gaslighting about real journalism.

Why do these people arrogantly claim that CNN is all fake propaganda, but the stuff they consume is somehow much better?

741,conspiracytheories,Puppycorn from Unikitty is adopted. (Will change flair if needed.),"For those who don't know, Unikitty is a show about a cat-unicorn hybrid named Unikitty (who's also a princess) that basically just goes on fun adventures with her friends, but sometimes they can get a little rough. In the show Unikitty has a brother named Puppycorn. You would think he's part unicorn, right? Well actually, in one episode called, ""P.L.O.T. device"" it is revealed that Puppycorn in actually a dog and a piece of corn. And as I stated before, Unikitty is a cat and unicorn.

&#x200B;

So, what does this mean? Well if you think about it, wouldn't the parents have to a cat, unicorn, dog, and a piece of corn? How would that work? The only way I can really think of is: Puppycorn is adopted. If this isn't enough information, then how is Puppycorn blue while Unikitty is pink, with the two colors being almost opposites? They're actually quite different in many ways, excluding personality because let's be real, just because someone acts similar to another person, doesn't mean they're siblings. So, Puppycorn is most likely adopted. Why not Unikitty being adopted? I mean, that could be another theory, but she is the princess of the entire kingdom, her castle is even shaped like her. Puppycorn didn't know he was a prince until ""Little Prince Puppycorn"" which was episode 13 of the show. of course, it could be that the parents were hybrids, but the two ""siblings"" still have a fair amount in differences.

751,conspiracytheories,It’s all rigged,"..and it’s always in the numbers 

Take for example, 227. 

You might have seen it in the news lately; the amount of miles that were devastated by a tornado in the Midwest yesterday

You’ll also find it in the amount of Palestinians that were killed during Israel’s last 11 day scuffle. 

Or the number of people that were initially reported in the hatti 7.2 earthquake that coincidently struck one day before the 227th day of the year… Melinda Gates birthday and also the anniversary of the Jesuit order; The day Afghanistan fell, also the day Robert Trump would be sacrificed 1 year earlier. 

You’ll also find “227” forwards and backwards forwards and backwards in the timespan between the day of the deadliest terrorist attack in US History - September 11th, and the Seaside Collapse 7,227 days, 9/11 also sharing a 227 day timespan in days with Justice Amy Coney Barrett’s January 28th birthday.. fitting, since the Justice that she would replace - Ruth Bader Ginsburg, would die on the 227th year anniversary of George Washington laying the Capitol Cornerstone. 

The United States would celebrate their official 4th of July on July 4th, 1870. 911 months 11 days before the birth of Donald Trump. 

Speaking of 911, George W. Bush, who was born 56,**147** days after construction of the White House began, which mind you has a total of **147** windows, and who very controversially “served” with the **147**th Battalion, and who’s father George H.W. Bush would die **147** days after his sons 72nd birthday or exactly **227** days after his wife’s Barbara Bush’s birthday

But back to the Don.

There are precisely 6,666 weeks between Adolf Hitler's day of birth and Donald Trump's Inauguration Day.

Donald Trump will turn 911 months old on the State of Israel’s 888 month birthday. 888 = Donald J. Trump, Project Blue Beam, Depopulation.

QA’non which sums to 666 would drop his first Q Drop 666 weeks after Donald Trump would wed Melania

If you’re looking to go down the rabbit hole, and like binge watching documentaries, can I offer mine up as a suggestion?

In 2020, the world as we knew it, would forever be changed, and it will never be the same.

On March 13th, 2020 - Donald Ducks birthday - the world would watch as Donald Trump would declare the first ever 50 state, state of emergency. Like many watching, I couldn’t believe what was unfolding before my eyes, and that day and in the blur and fog of what was transpiring that day something inside of me clicked.   Maybe it was the fact that none of it made sense, or the fact that I had been waiting for this  event my whole life - but in the end what did it for me was the numbers.   Was it a coincidence that the United States would declare its first ever 50 state of Emergency on March 13th? The same day that Pope Francis would celebrate his 7 year anniversary, the same day that would see the death of Breonna Taylor, the same day - 23 years earlier - that some strange lights would engulf the nighttime Phoenix Arizona skies? 2 days after the world health organization would declare Covid-19 a global pandemic.

On March 11th, the same day that the first death of the Spanish flu would claim it’s first victim in the US, the same day that 18 years before the WHO’s March 11, the United States would send two blue light beams into the infinite vastness of space, a message “into the unknown” from 9/11’s ground zero.

I don’t believe in coincidence and whether you know it or not, we live in the matrix, and it has a language. It’s called Gematria - a code hidden in plain sight, in letters and numbers, in bedded in our every day life. Nothing has ever been real.   Let me prove it to you.

The Republican Party uses their followers to gaslight the rest of us and enforce their will.

They are publicly demanding to exterminate the votes of Americans to force that retarded psychopath back into power over everyone against their consent.

And even after Jan. 6, people are falling even more madly in love with this absolute shitshow insanity cult and rewarding it with even more votes and cash donations than ever before.

The divide in America is between those who view Trump as a mentally retarded psychopath and extremely dangerous to all of us - and the Republican  Party that is grooming worsening insanity in their followers.

The Republican Party grooms insanity, then blames everyone else for being unhinged.

The same thing they did with Trump they also did with climate change. It's a liberal hoax, it's fake news. After decades of denial, Republican politicians and Fox News destroyed the last chances we had to save ourselves with their demented insanity.

The cult grooms their followers to blocks out all humans outside their control and only love and worship and chant their fucked up ""narratives.""

They let that Republican retard cause that suicide terrorist attack on the Capitol, then used their followers to mass blame ~~the Jews~~ 'antifah' for their own insanity.

The cult does extreme vile things, then accuses the rest of us for not loving Trump hard enough.

Republicans are designed to be infinitely arrogant self-deluded disasters that block out all science, logic and reason and only consume and red-pill the cult narrative.

It's a cult designed to breed eternally loyal voters and donors who are lost in the Fox News fantasy and are groomed to be too stupid to know or care about the immense devastation they cause.

They make up insanity - like blacks are stealing votes from them - and then they blame all of us for hiding the secret evidence from them.

It's a totally circular system. Fox News grooms Republican voters with junk insanity, and Republican politicians then claim to solve the problems they themselves made up. And anyone who doesn't love the cult is fake/biased/rigged/unfair/mean.

Republicans are trained to attack anything that doesn't worship the insanity cult or believe their opposite world bullshit.

The Republican is a self-deluding insanity cult, and it's dragging the entire world to hell with it while making massive profits all the way.

You know you left your keys on the table, but you found it on the counter. The Depend brand used to be Depends. I propose that both of these stem from the same effect.

The Mandela effect is a strange thing. It basically states that large groups of people are ""mis-remembering"" events, such as Darth Vaders famous ""Luke, I am your father"" line, instead being ""No, I am your father"" and others. In my case, I watched the Star Wars DvD's, and remember the ""Luke I am your father"" line very clearly.

Look at it like this. Each line is a separate universe.:

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------

\---------------------------------+-------------------+-------------------

\-------------------------------------------------------------------------+

All of these are near identical, except for a few differences. Over time, these two universes will actually merge into one reality, and that results in some displacement. Which is why the ""Mandela Effect"" exists, and some people to have slightly different memories of famous events, and why you are correct when your item appears somewhere it isn't supposed too. Because in the merged universe, it was in that location, and not here.

So what you get is:

\----------------------------------+---------------------+-------------+

Most of these effects, I believe, are rather small in scale. The name of a brand changing overnight, a line from one of the most famous movies ever made somehow being different, and memories and locations of objects being different. I suspect that our separate universes only merge when they are similar enough to not cause a disturbance, such as a different president or different technology.

838,conspiracytheories,It’s all rigged..,"..and it’s always in the numbers 


Take for example, 227. 

You might have seen it in the news today; the amount of miles that were devastated by a tomado in the Midwest today. 

You’ll also find it in the amount of Palestinians that were killed during Israel’s last 11’day scuffle. 

Or the number of people that were initially reported in the hatti 7.2 earthquake that coincidently struck one day before the 227th day of the year… Melinda Gates birthday and also the anniversary of the Jesuit order; The day Afghanistan fell, also the day Robert Trump would be sacrificed 1 year earlier. 

You’ll also find “227” forwards and backwards forwards and backwards in the timespan between the day of the deadliest terrorist attack in US History - September 11th, and the Seaside Collapse 7,227 days, 9/11 also sharing a 227 day timespan in days with Justice Amy Coney Barrett’s January 28th birthday.. fitting, since the Justice that she would replace - Ruth Bader Ginsburg, would die on the 227th year anniversary of George Washington laying the Capitol Cornerstone. 

The United States would celebrate their official 4th of July on July 4th, 1870. 911 months 11 days before the birth of Donald Trump

There are precisely 6,666 weeks between Adolf Hitler's day of birth and Donald Trump's Inauguration Day.

Donald Trump will turn 911 months old on the State of Israel’s 888 month birthday. 888 = Donald J. Trump, Project Blue Beam, Depopulation.

QA’non which sums to 666 would drop his first Q Drop 666 weeks after Donald Trump would wed Melania

Now, I  acknowledge that what I’m about to say sounds like the ramblings of a crazy person, but I have spent so much time trying to put these ramblings into something that makes a little sense, so it would be awesome if you could hear me out my

If you’re looking to go down the rabbit hole, and like binge watching documentaries, can I offer mine up as a suggestion?

In 2020, the world as we knew it, would forever be changed, and it will never be the same.

On March 13th, 2020 - Donald Ducks birthday - the world would watch as Donald Trump would declare the first ever 50 state, state of emergency. Like many watching, I couldn’t believe what was unfolding before my eyes, and that day and in the blur and fog of what was transpiring that day something inside of me clicked.   Maybe it was the fact that none of it made sense, or the fact that I had been waiting for this  event my whole life - but in the end what did it for me was the numbers.   Was it a coincidence that the United States would declare its first ever 50 state of Emergency on March 13th? The same day that Pope Francis would celebrate his 7 year anniversary, the same day that would see the death of Breonna Taylor, the same day - 23 years earlier - that some strange lights would engulf the nighttime Phoenix Arizona skies? 2 days after the world health organization would declare Covid-19 a global pandemic.

On March 11th, the same day that the first death of the Spanish flu would claim it’s first victim in the US, the same day that 18 years before the WHO’s March 11, the United States would send two blue light beams into the infinite vastness of space, a message “into the unknown” from 9/11’s ground zero.

I don’t believe in coincidence and whether you know it or not, we live in the matrix, and it has a language. It’s called Gematria - a code hidden in plain sight, in letters and numbers, in bedded in our every day life. Nothing has ever been real.   Let me prove it to you.

It’s been quite the journey, for all of us, and it’s far from over. So buckle up, and hold on to each other because in this world, it has and always will be us vs them. There is no left; there is no right - don’t let them keep taking us from each other.

…the aliens aren’t coming, they’ve never left

A lot of people want to find the truth, but too often that now means chasing junk insanity down rabbit holes, consuming lies that lead to more lies.

So what if there was some community platform where people can work together in teams to investigate ""conspiracies""?

They can learn how to investigate real information, how to file Freedom of Information requests and then dig through the reports.

It can be detailed looks at political contributions, environmental reports. You could request documents from the Defense Department on the sale of military goods to foreign countries and dig deep. You could investigate corporate acquisitions, stock trades, alien sightings.

It doesn't even have to be about anything bad. You could look through expense reports of your local municipalities and check out how local tax dollars are spent.

A conspiracy community that actually works together to find answers.

I've noticed a lot of grifters will just say everything is fake, the government is bad, this is bad that is bad. And then when they fill you with doubt they feed you even more corrupt dishonesty and lies for money and power and profit.

879,conspiracytheories,Alaska Payment Conspiracy,"The Alaska Payment Conspiracy is a conspiracy theory that the Russian Empire never received payment for the Alaska purchase from the United States, and that instead the ship, the Orkney, that carried the payment in gold was detonated for insurance money by Alexander Keith Jr, a con artist and explosives expert.

**The Conspiracy**

The Orkney supposedly sank in the Baltic Sea, on route to St. Petersburg from London, the then capital of the Russian Empire. Alexander Keith, who was known by several aliases, including William Thompson, had experience previously exploding ships to claim insurance money in Europe. His most well-known was that of the Mosel which occurred later. It has also been suggested that Keith may have been involved in the sinking of at least two other ships - the SS City of Boston and the Marie Victoria.

**Explanation**

As a start, the money was used to buy railroad equipment that was intended for Kursk-Kiev, Ryazan, Kozlovsky, Moscow-Ryazan and other railway lines\*\*.\*\* This suggests the funds were spent immediately, suggesting that it would not be possible for it to have been sent in gold.

Secondly, according to the conspiracy theory, the Orkney exploded before the money was due. It is claimed that the ship was sunk in mid-July 1868, while the payment was supposed to be delivered on the 1st August 1868. Furthermore, there is no record of a ship called the Orkney going missing, only a similarly named ship called Orkney Lass, which was registered after the events as still in operation and was supposedly travelling to South America that year, not St. Petersburg. No gold has ever been found in the Baltic Sea.

Lastly, bombs were very complicated to make at the time and Keith Jr. would spend a lot of time to prepare one. There are also conflicting stories about how Keith became involved - one story claims he was approached while living in Germany, the other says he thought of the scheme while working as a stevedore in England. Finally, there is a lack of evidence to connect Keith to the bombing, only that he was involved in the Mosel bombing a decade later.

**In Fiction**

● The book Forty-Ninth by Boris Pronsky and Craig Britton, fictionalises the events prior to, during and after the conspiracy.

● The Dynamite Fiend by Ann Larabee, examines the life of Alexander Keith and his criminal career, including the bombing of the Mosel.",rcp4qc,9,,1639078117.0,0,0.86

I know. So hear me out.... but I first want to say that I am in no way talking shit about the people of that sub, and that the sub itself brings up some very valid points about workplace quality and the classism that holds up our society.

With that said, I think its sketchy the kind of following that that sub has, and its rise to popularity so suddenly. r/conspiracytheories top post is like 25k updoots, and in the sub in question, the highest is 273k... and \~4500 awards. Sure they have a million more followers, but hear me out. 

The rate of popularity of that sub seems to be continuously growing. The post with 273k updoots is a picture of a text thread, and it rowled up enough people to be one of the most highly updooted posts of all time. Here is a chart from Benzinga highlighting the top posts of 2021:

\>These were the top five most upvoted posts in 2021, according to Reddit.

\>A billboard in Times Square that read “GME Go BRRR” gained over 433,000 upvotes on Reddit after being posted on r/wallstreetbets.

\>A post discussing **Robinhood Markets** and its role in possibly hiding “meme stocks” to users. The post encouraged users to “take all the cash you can afford to lose and buy buy buy” had over 323,000 upvotes on r/wallstreetbets.

\>A post from Gill showing him losing over $14 million in one day from the falling price of GameStop gained over 287,000 upvotes on r/wallstreetbets.

\>A screenshot from a Reddit user sharing they quit their job got over 273,000 upvotes on r/antiwork.

\>A man avoiding a cash-in-transit robbery was upvoted over 259,000 times on r/nextf\*\*kinglevel.

&#x200B;

Anyway, it seems logical to me that certain interests that have a long history of asserting their agenda via decades long subversion would be all over helping to destabilize western workforce moral. Upvotes are symbolic of collective sentiment, and reddit has a way of really hyping people up; it has become a source for much of the information people use to form their opinions. I mean, just look at the top 3 posts of 2021, the GME saga is living proof of what I'm saying,  the weight of reddit's power over people's actions (like betting your life savings on GameStop) is significant. 

The popularity of the sub in question is a glaring realization that a lot of people are fed up with the ""system"". They have an idea and its growing. And if that idea were to ever spill over into action, it would be a big deal. It would be a change that would most certainly not be made easily. It would cause massive conflict and make for an easy target. Further, a main component of any ideological overhaul -like revolutionizing society's relationship with work - is that there is an enculturation of the younger people, so that definitive attitudes can be latched onto as a culturally cornerstoned belief; thus creating a ""generation"" mentality. Grabbing the attention of young people and telling them its okay to tell your company to fuck off because the boss puts work over being a human being, is exactly what kids are looking for. And they're right. But that's not the point. I'm hoping you get the point by now.

The opportunity is there, and it just seems too obvious. A psyop that grabs the hearts and minds of young people and the fed-up, and can have the impression of being 100% crowdsourced and grassroots... pshh, what a crock of shit.",rccp3t,8,,1639035668.0,13,0.65
